It also handles emulation up to the PS2(most games*)/PSP like a champ (many ARM versions exist for emulators now too, so thats a plus!)Honestly, microsoft did good here. You can still run traditional exes built for x86/x64 and it will emulate the instructions to ARM (very cool) and it runs native ARM executables.I'm not a huge fan of its dedicated weird charging port... and I had to get a stronger usb cable for charging and a stronger battery bank that supported the wattage required for this thing to even recognize it as a charger for whatever reason.. But otherwise good.\n  \nRead more",

After it was it returned it get locking up on restart. Didn't know if it hardware compatibility problems so I went thru one by one eliminated those which meant wiping PC clean and restarting from USB boot drive and reloading. The I starting eliminating software. Finally found that the problem was restoring Pictures and Music files from backup hard drives. Apparently the ARM takes a long time to actually finish copying the data to the C: drive and I was restarting before it was finished. Even though the dialog box shows that process is complete it is still running in the background and it takes like 30 minutes or more to finish copying everything over.  I checked the properties of the input folders to the output and they were the same but the process was still running in the background.  What's the point of a fast processor is it runs like an old XP PC? I would have returned the PC but my return date was 3/3/2025 and when I got all this figured out I was a day late!\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Just got my Surface Laptop 3 and I'm happy to report when I took it out of the box and inspected it, it looked like a brand new machine.  I was concerned when I ordered it based on the 2 reviews that this listing had, but I guess I lucked out.  The laptop itself is in excellent condition.  The only flaw I could find on the body is a 1mm scratch on one corner that I was able to cover/hide with a black sharpie.  Now you don't even see it.  The screen is absolutely flawless.  The keyboard is flawless.  Sometimes with laptops, over time, the keys get faded or you notice that oily residue on them that doesn't wash off.  This keyboard looks like it's never been used.  The trackpad is perfect.  The only thing I can't speak to is the battery life remaining.  The \"excellent\" condition by this seller states that the battery is supposed to be above 80% life.  I've charged it fully and discharged it 2 times so far and it seems like the battery is fine.  All the ports work fine and I updated it to Windows 11 without issue.  The laptop came with a power adapter and that's all.  It was packed inside an inflatable bubble wrap and was well protected.  Seller shipped via Fed-ex 2 day shipping for free.  All in all, no complaints.  Very happy.  I did notice that the price fluctuates on this model from this seller.  Sometimes it's a little higher or lower than what I paid.  Not sure why.\n  \nRead more",

The first one arrived with a broken charging cable and NO internal battery. This tablet makes a VERY loud sound coming from the fan, and the battery gets very warm very fast. I need this tablet for school, and I couldn't possibly use this in class as it would be a huge noise distraction. I adjusted the battery to recommended setting, updated, and restarted all like 3 times. Nothing worked. It's going back to this shady company, and I will not purchase anything from them again. They clearly cannot QA/QC...or they just don't care. Huge waste of my time.\n  \nRead more",

The only problem is the included AC adapter is bad…luckily i had an adapter from the computer I was replacing. I used the poor Amazons chat customer service to let them know the PC worked but the ac adapter was bad, and all I needed was a replacement ac adapter. They said ok, a day later I get a approved refund request which I never asked for, all I need is the ac adapter for the computer, no reason the seller should have to replace the entire pc. I needed a pc since mine died, otherwise I wouldn’t have ordered it, I don’t want a refund. If the only way to get a replacement adapter through Amazons poor customer service is to replace the entire computer I’ll just go without and leave a bad review. I am happy to update this bad review if seller can resolve the issue that Amazon has actually made worse.\n  \nRead more",

                "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Finally, a proper Macbook Air Competitor",
                "review": "Years ago, I had the original Surface Laptop, and I loved it. It remains one of my favorite laptops of all time.So before I purchased the Surface Laptop 7, I actually had a 14\" 2021 Macbook Pro. It was honestly too much laptop for my needs, but the limited port selection on the Macbook Airs ruled them out for me. Of course, my Macbook Pro was better than the Surface Laptop 7 in many ways - the mini-LED screen is just about the best laptop display you can get, full-stop, whereas the Surface's display is good but not great. The speakers on the Macbook were amazing; the Surface's are quite good but can't compete in that regard.However, I don't regret my purchase for one second because the Surface Laptop 7 is really a Macbook Air competitor, and that is where it shines. I compared the Surface and Macbook Air 13\" side by side and came away with the following conclusions:-Screen: I don't do any serious photo editing or graphic design. To me, the Surface screen is slightly better. It gets much brighter than the Air and colors seem more accurate. However, the Air has better black levels. The Surface is a touchscreen, but I never use it as I don't like fingerprints on my screens. However, if you want a touchscreen, the Surface is clearly the better option. The Surface also has a 120hz display, whereas the Air is stuck at 60hz. The difference in smoothness when scrolling or using trackpad gestures is very noticeable. The Surface's screen looks much smoother.-Speakers: I can't tell the difference between the two. The Surface's speakers are really good compared to other laptops in this class. The same is true of the Macbook Air.-Ports: I had hoped that by 2024, USB-A would be all but gone, but alas it is not. It was very annoying to have to carry around dongles to use USB-A devices on my Macbook Pro, and now I don't have to! The Air has only two USB-C ports, so clearly the Surface wins here. The Macbook Pro does have HDMI, which is nice, but I just bought a USB-C to HDMI cable that I carry around with me, so I don't need a dongle for that either.-Keyboard: I like that the Macbook Air has more than 3 levels of brightness control, but I slightly prefer the key feel on the Surface.- Trackpad: somehow, the Surface's trackpad is better. I am thrilled that Microsoft finally brought a haptic trackpad to the Surface lineup. It feels more delicate and the tactility is stronger. Macbook trackpads are still among the best in the business, but there is finally a Windows laptop that is comparable in this regard.-Login: hands down, Windows Hello is better than the fingerprint reader. It's so fast that my Surface often logs me that it feels like the laptop was left unlocked. The fingerprint scanner on Macbooks are very good, but they are not as fast, nor as convenient, as Windows Hello. My Macbook Pro could also unlock with my Apple Watch, but that almost always took longer than unlocking with my finger.-Build Quality: This has always been a strong point for Surface devices, and the Surface Laptop 7 doesn't disappoint. The laptop can be opened easily with one hand, and the fit and finish is flawless. The same is true of the Macbook Air. I can't say whether one is better than the other. The Surface is designed to be easier to service, however, and you can actually replace the SSD, which is very nice. Additionally, the black finish on my Surface is more resistant to showing fingerprints than the dark blue on the Macbook Airs, which is a fingerprint magnet.-Performance: After owning an Apple Silicon laptop, I could never go back to using an x86/x64 processor. I used Windows 11 for ARM on my Macbook for two years virtualized in Paralells, so I knew what I was getting into. All of the applications I need work beautifully on the Surface, and it is so darn fast. Of course, there are more powerful processors out there using traditional x64 architecture, but I have never used a Windows laptop that is just so snappy for every day tasks. Office apps open in 1-2 seconds. Firefox, Chrome, and Edge open in less than a second. Using gestures to swipe through apps is super snappy, and the high refresh rate screen makes transitions look so smooth. This is the kind of performance I came to except from my Apple Silicon Macbook, and it's wonderful to finally see Windows operating just as responsively.Overall, the Surface feels like an upgrade over my Macbook Pro, and I personally am fine with the tradeoffs that come with the thinner, smaller, and lighter Surface over the more powerful Macbook Pro. It is an utterly fantastic laptop that, in my opinion, is currently the best thin-and-light laptop in the world.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "This incredible, beautiful, elegant and productive laptop showcases what Microsoft is truly capable of, and I'm a Linux guy. I bought the big one - 15\" screen, 32 gig RAM, elite CPU. It is a powerhouse of a laptop.Now - there is one con, but as time progresses the problem becomes less and less of a problem and that is the ARM architecture vs standard Intel x86/64. Basically, this laptop uses a newer, different CPU architecture, which means that many applications don't work yet (YET!!). Almost everything I threw at this laptop worked out of the box and worked beautifully. There were some older applications that didn't work (SimCity Deluxe for example). But and this is a huge BUT - as time passes more applications are supported (or emulated effectively) and it becomes less and less an issue.With the 1 CON out of the way, let's talk about how amazing this laptop is:Premium feel (shell and keyboard). As good as or even better than a MacBook. Yes, for real.Speakers sound delightful.The 15\"-inch sounds like a big laptop but fits perfectly in my backpack and it is still light and small. I mean, unless you are a 5'2\" petite tiny person I don't see how this 15\" laptop is too big for someone.It is plenty fast for doing all sorts of productivity like writing papers, excel spreadsheeting, music, internet, YouTube etc. Understand this isn't a fancy Chromebook. Operating System / Applications are exceptionally fast. This laptop WILL make you more productive just by opening it. It makes you want to work it's so nice.Battery life is OUTSTANDING. If you aren't glued to this laptop for hours at a time the battery will last DAYS. Literally days.Touchpad is also legit. No problems with cursor moving around (palm detection) and typing. Just legit good.Even when watching movies it doesn't get hot. Temperature is steady and cool. I love ARM.In closing, get this laptop. It's nice. Really nice. Like honestly, the nicest laptop I've ever owned (I've had the ASUS ROG 2024, two Dell XPS 15's, Razer Blades, etc.,)For my fellow nerds in the crowd:VMWare & Vbox do NOT work. Remember that ARM is a RISC architecture and neither products support ARM (yet). Docker Desktop for Windows DOES work on ARM. Also, WSL 2.0 also works just fine.Also, with the advent of cloud, lightweight servers (I run a small cloud on my home network) we don't need powerhouse laptops anymore if you have supporting infra. When I'm on travel I just VPN into my home network and I have all the resources I need. So keep something light and portable to work from :)\n  \nRead more",

Love that it was really nicely packaged and protected and given its a high value product they call you to get a code before leaving which is much appreciated. Great experience purchasing and unboxing! Love this laptop. Personally I love windows and can never get used to using a Mac despite having an iPhone, I love my excel shortcuts and having a touch screen so this was best choice at a reasonable price.\n  \nRead more",

These signs strongly suggest that the laptop may have been used or returned previously.This is unacceptable, especially for what should have been a new product.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I recently purchased the Microsoft Surface Pro 7 (Renewed) with 256GB storage, i7 processor, and 16GB RAM and had a generally positive experience, though with some caveats.Pros:First, the condition of the device was impressive. As a renewed product, it looked and felt practically new. The 12.3-inch touchscreen is vibrant, responsive, and works well for both productivity and entertainment. The i7 processor and 16GB of RAM ensure smooth performance, even when handling demanding tasks like multitasking and running multiple apps simultaneously. For my daily work needs, the Surface Pro 7 provided solid reliability.The Windows 10 Pro system is easy to navigate, and the portability of the device is perfect for those who need a lightweight but powerful tablet/laptop hybrid. It's excellent for both work and leisure, especially with the sharp display and excellent touch functionality. Additionally, the Wi-Fi connection was stable, and the overall build quality was top-notch.Cons:Unfortunately, I did run into a significant issue with this device. Upon arrival, I noticed that the battery charging did not work. Despite trying several charging cables and outlets, it would not charge beyond a certain point, which was quite frustrating, especially for a device that’s supposed to be fully functional.However, I must commend the return process. The seller made it easy to return the product and issue a full refund, which was a relief. It’s reassuring to know that purchasing a renewed product doesn’t come with a high risk, as the return process was seamless and quick.Overall: While the product itself was in great condition for being refurbished, the battery charging issue was a deal-breaker. Thankfully, the excellent return and refund policy meant that I wasn’t stuck with a faulty device. I’m still interested in purchasing a replacement, but this experience showed me that buying renewed products can come with risks, even if the overall condition seems good.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I really like this Surface Pro 7. It is exactly as advertised with one exception. The battery life is nowhere near what is advertised. On battery saving mode, using only Onenote for taking class notes, it lasts about 4 hours. Fortunately it charges up very quickly though. I can't see any way that I would get a full days use out of a full battery charge in any circumstance. In my case that is not very important because I am always around an outlet but if you need a tablet that will last all day away from a power source you will have a problem. The camera is good enough, not as good as the Apple camera, but I don't really use it as a camera anyway. I use mostly the 365 programs and find that it integrates these programs seamlessly. Onenote comes with the tablet and has been an amazing app for my vet school classes.  It saves my many hours of study time. My only issues are with the instability of Onenote. It closes itself down every few minutes and is very frustrating. I'm sure there is a fix for this but I'm also sure that I won't get it from Microsorft as they have a technical support team that is on par with the customer service team at the cable company. I've contacted them 3 times now and my issue is never addressed. I was actually told to contact Amazon since they sold it to me. It seems like after spending a thousand dollars on Microsoft products they would at least provide a bit of tech support.  I'll just have to scour the web for a fix to this I guess. Overall I would recommend this tablet to every student. It seems to be a fantastic and fast machine.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Well where do i start..... i ended up getting my item and everything was good for about 20mins of use... however after 20mins my screen would freeze for 10-30 secs. I blew it off at first but then it happen 10mins after then it became a often issue. So i ended up going for an exchange. (The worst idea I’ve ever had). I called up amazon and told them my issue and they were quick to get me a replacement so as first i was satisfied until the surface pro 7 came in the next day. I open the box to find out the box it comes in is not only damage but in a renewed box didn’t even come in the same box it should have come in, then i open that to see the surface pro and the screen film wrapped around it was really dirty as if they dropped it in dirt or so and fingerprints all over the machine. So at this point I’m just hoping it works. This one was not charged at all at 15% like it usually is if you were to buy from Microsoft or an apple device would normally be. So i put it on the charger to find out that it not only has screen tear straight down the middle of the screen but a big red dot half the size of the screen was on there as if they drop the surface pro. So at this point i immediately call amazon and i talked to a representative that ended up giving me a hard time about another replacement even though this one was obviously there fault. So i ended up talking to a supervisor that ended up giving me a hard time as well and in the she said to me that they only do a exchange once but as a one time exception they’ll do the exchange to which i responded with i only want to do the exchange if it’s a brand new product that they are giving me not a renewed one and undamaged. To which she agreed that she would make sure it would be done and put in her notes so the wear house  knows. Well the next day came and guess what.... the man that drops it off throws my package at the wall of my house from a big distance he didn’t see me at all so when i raced over the man jumped in his car and quickly drove away knowing what he did. Not only this but when i open the box the surface pro again was in a dirty renewed box, at this point I’m just hoping it still even worked again no power so i plug it in and guess what it works surprisingly after all that. However i Notice something was different with the boot up process so i knew something was wrong i go to the setting of the computer and the version i bought was 8gb of ram i5 model with 128gb of memory the one i receive as a replacement this time was a 4gb version i5 model with 128gb of memory and GUESS WHAT A DIFFERENT GRAPHICS CARD AS WELL. The surface pro 7 i got not only had 4gb of ram which was wrong but a different graphics card as well that comes in a surface pro 5 are you serious.... so i called up customer service again asking for a supervisor yet again..... just wanting a refund the man told me well i see here that you have a couple of exchange for this device already so i told him this story i am telling now and ask him i wonder why i have “a couple of exchanges” to which he said well instead of a refund i can get you a brand new one and told me how he had to make a couple of phone calls to do this for me so i told him this is the last exchange I’ll be getting ill be asking for a refund next like i previously wanted..if the next one comes in the renewed box which that would mean it’s used.. if it’s broken or the wrong model I’m done with trying and I’m done with the surface pro 7. not only was this the worst experience with amazon that I’ve ever had and worst costumer Service but now I’m going to hate the surface pro 7 because of this. I’ll see what i receive next as of 02/23/2020Sorry for the long review but i felt my experience should be shared for others to see.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "My previous laptop was a godzilla, 15 inch monitor, weighs like 3 pounds or something (2014 model). I was looking for something that had the horsepower for what I needed, but also the lightness to carry it around. Although battery life isnt, the best, I DON'T MIND!This thing is a beast! Im very happy running programs like tableau, zoom, excel, powerpoint, all at the same time and with various files and this thing doesn't even flinch. The first few hours setting up and downloading all the programs it felt a big sluggish and I was starting to get worried. Once that was done, it started to fly.Yes, the rotating screen isnt as flawless as apple's iPad. That said, I bought this not to look pretty, i bought it to be my tool in battle. Being able to run all the programs that a regular PC can run is the main decision I went for Microsoft Surface.  The only downside is that Microsoft is a bit costly on the accessories front.I recommend this piece of tech to anyone who needs to travel or is on the move.  I'm a relatively big guy and i've had no major problem with the size of the keyboard. I do put it FLAT on tables because my keystrokes tend to be pretty hard and the keyboard is the most (in my opinion) fragile of the accessories.Lastly, the Pen interface is not perfect YET but oh man, as a first timer working with it, it kicks total ass and makes note taking in OneNote a complete positive trip.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I am a student-teacher. As such I have to take notes, as well as make lessons for students. This device is fantastic for note-taking and creating documents for schools. The screen is beautiful, and while I wish the bezels were as slim as they were on the surface pro x, I think the bezels are still fine and you tend not to notice them when you're using the device. With a resolution of 2736x1824 (yes, it's a weird resolution) on a 12.3 screen, everything is tack sharp and it has good colour accuracy. I do have a screen calibration tool and did notice quite the difference after calibrating it, but most people will be fine with the base settings.I wouldn't recommend getting the base model (i3 and 4GB ram) since let's be honest, a 4GB ram shouldn't even exist at this point. I think the i5 is the sweet spot, since the i7 isn't really that much better, along with whatever storage option you think you'd need. I'm okay with 256GB. Also, note it does have expandable storage via a micro SD card up to 1TB. The performance on this device is also great about 95% of the time. I get a few weird issues and stutters from time to time, but that is most likely due to windows being windows.The weakest point of this device would definitely be the battery life. While there are worse options out there, I do wish that the battery was slightly better. Having a lot of virtual meetings given the pandemic requires a lot of webcam use and multitasking, and I find that after a couple of hours the battery is already around 30% - with battery-saving mode enabled. When you're not doing that, and you're doing just standard web-browsing and media consumption, you'll be looking at a solid 5-6 hours minimum at acceptable brightness levels.Another negative is that while yes, this device is great, but if you want the full experience, you still have to purchase the type cover, which is another $150+ and the surface pen, which is another $100. So keep in mind that whatever option you choose, you're going to be spending another $300 after taxes.Overall though, writing notes on this device is fantastic, especially if you already use Microsoft 365. I think you can get by with the battery life, and you won't be disappointed by the performance unless you are a heavy user.\n  \nRead more",

You absolutely want 8 GB of ram and the Core M3 chip to get a half way fluid desktop experience. The 4gb and Pentium gold version functions but it chokes so much even webbrowsing while downloading updates is janky and that makes it hard to use as a \"normal computer\". 128 GB is really also what you need as the 64gb version will have so much space taken up by windows, windows install files and hybernation files you will have to constantly juggle things to store more than a dozen GB unless you use a Microsoft card.Disable the fancy visual effects and it's just a very solid experience. Battery life is solid and the built in kickstand works great. Is it/should it be stuck with Windows 10? Yes, basically, but that's fine for the near future. If you have fixed needs this is just wonderfully \"good enough\"\n  \nRead more",

I am running Windows 11 on this sucker doing the exact same workload, and it immediately fixed EVERY SINGLE COMPLAINT I had with the Go 1. The RAM and i3 CPU were what was badly needed!

But I would’ve rather paid for a new surface pro. I’m really disappointed and honestly going to be attempting to return. I took numerous videos of my unboxing and first time experience. If I could have uploaded more than 1 video I definitely would have.I’m sure everyone will not have the same experience as I. Just how about don’t lie about your product? Plenty of people would be happy with something like this but at a cheaper price. A damaged screen, unclean charger, and hardware that has to be fixed in a certain position to charge is definitely not “like new”, “excellent”, or even “refurbished”. Cool you wiped the device and threw it in a box. I’m not impressed.\n  \nRead more",

You can use this USB stick to restore the system if it ever gets wiped out by malware or ransomware - just keep all your data in the cloud and your are bullet-proof.  After you build the system you can then sell it for money, as long as you include the Windows USB stick and the Key.  If you try to build many machines with the one USB stick and key you will find problems.  All that said - Windows 11 is not the best OS out there - but it's the one everyone expects.

It is a pain and unless you are using it for an application where you have IT support you likely don’t need one.The PC is dying despite the advantages of its form factor and it is all Microsoft’s fault. They got a monopoly then used the power to make the user experience worse with every edition since at least Windows 7 and probably Windows XP remains the high point for Windows.The process of setting it up should be Microsoft’s chance to shine. Make a good first impression by having a product that just works. Instead you are stuck wasting time because you don’t have hardwired internet and have to lug the computer to the router. Then it doesn’t want to let you install without a Microsoft account. Then you buy the kids a game, and of course it remembers your credit card so they can easily order whatever they want without asking for the card. Not even a the dignity of a check box to not remember the card!The only consolation of a painful few hours setting up a computer is that this horrible user experience has driven the PC into collapse. I asked my wife if she wanted one along with my kids and while she had one for years in the bright days of Windows XP, she didn’t really care to get off her phone long enough to use a computer.\n  \nRead more",

The Surface Pro 4 was purchased and left in box as a backup until needed. It was stored in a climate controlled office with other similar equipment.  It will only stay on when plugged in. Once you pull the plug, it turns off, so the battery is useless.  It also doesn't boot up normally.  Though I did not find these issues out until after the warranty period, I called Lifecycle Pro to see what we could work out.  I was willing to send back the tablet at my expense to have them fix the battery issue, or I was also willing to send it back and get a store credit on another tablet. Its my fault for not checking the condition of the device when it was received, so I get it. It was in the original box and not opened, so the problems it has now, would've been there upon receipt. I would've offered a customer some level of credit or something...Lifecycle Pro offered nothing.  Considering the 2 tablets I have purchased from them are of little to no value, They made a few hundred, offered subpar tech, and definitely lost our business.\n  \nRead more",

This battery lasts half the time my pro 3 did and is slower than my pro 3.I'm disappointed with it, but it gets the job done. Well, as long as I cool it down and give it a rest when it begins to flicker and am a little patient with it.Honestly, I get more things done and faster on my Samsung phone which replaces most computers (unlike iphones....sorry had to put that in there ;p).Best if you go with Pro 7 or 8 and make monthly payments instead.

I literally ordered one the next day! I had been in the market for a new tablet, and thought maybe I wanted an iPad, but I just couldn't seem to pull the trigger. I don't like the mobile interface of apple products (despite loving the desktop interface on my iMac). I had a Galaxy Tab 2, which I liked for a while, but I also don't really love the Android interface for a tablet, although I love it for my phone. So, this has been the perfect solution. It's a laptop, but a tablet, but a laptop. It's just frickin' amazing. I also really like Windows 10. I stopped following Windows products when Windows 8 came out, but 10 has been a nice blend of 7 and 8. This really is the best of all worlds!\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Overall I really like the computer. It's fast and compact and it starts up quickly. It was refurbished and being sold in ”good\" condition. I assumed some scratches on the outside of it like the back or whatever, and it has some of those. But that's fine, no big deal. I assumed it might even have some minor chips or scratches in the glass screen around the edges, and there were, but again no big deal. What I was not expecting was multiple dead patches of pixels on the screen. I certainly wouldn't call that \"good\" condition when little scattered parts of the screen don't work. It's condition is \"ok\" at best. So I'm more than a little disappointed. And the charger that was sent with it must have also been refurbished too, but very poorly. When plugged in, it makes an incredibly loud humming sound that can be heard across the room, and that can be felt in your hand if you pick it up. So careful about what your getting, because their definition of \"good\" is just barely passable. Wishing I spent the extra money to just buy a new one.\n  \nRead more",

I recommend an anti-glare (matte finish) screen protector to control fingerprints and give a nice feeling writing surface if you use the pen.Also a big reason to pick a 7+ over just a 7 is this is a later gen processor so big improvements there, also the SSD is easily expandable, I'll be able to take this surface from 126G to 1TB storage for less than $100 makes this an easy choice.If I have any issues in the future I'll update the review, overall super happy purchase.\n  \nRead more",

There was no problem downloading my photoshop but the tablet has a mid-screen invisible line that does not pick up drawings. The midline remains blank and there is a jarring jump from top to bottom of it (and usually to left or right) when you try to draw across the center of the screen, making it pretty much unusable for that purpose. At first I thought it was the screen protector, then the digital pen, but after changing all of those it's obviously the tablet that is is defective. Definitely will never buy refurbished products again.\n  \nRead more",

                "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Finally, a proper Macbook Air Competitor",
                "review": "Years ago, I had the original Surface Laptop, and I loved it. It remains one of my favorite laptops of all time.So before I purchased the Surface Laptop 7, I actually had a 14\" 2021 Macbook Pro. It was honestly too much laptop for my needs, but the limited port selection on the Macbook Airs ruled them out for me. Of course, my Macbook Pro was better than the Surface Laptop 7 in many ways - the mini-LED screen is just about the best laptop display you can get, full-stop, whereas the Surface's display is good but not great. The speakers on the Macbook were amazing; the Surface's are quite good but can't compete in that regard.However, I don't regret my purchase for one second because the Surface Laptop 7 is really a Macbook Air competitor, and that is where it shines. I compared the Surface and Macbook Air 13\" side by side and came away with the following conclusions:-Screen: I don't do any serious photo editing or graphic design. To me, the Surface screen is slightly better. It gets much brighter than the Air and colors seem more accurate. However, the Air has better black levels. The Surface is a touchscreen, but I never use it as I don't like fingerprints on my screens. However, if you want a touchscreen, the Surface is clearly the better option. The Surface also has a 120hz display, whereas the Air is stuck at 60hz. The difference in smoothness when scrolling or using trackpad gestures is very noticeable. The Surface's screen looks much smoother.-Speakers: I can't tell the difference between the two. The Surface's speakers are really good compared to other laptops in this class. The same is true of the Macbook Air.-Ports: I had hoped that by 2024, USB-A would be all but gone, but alas it is not. It was very annoying to have to carry around dongles to use USB-A devices on my Macbook Pro, and now I don't have to! The Air has only two USB-C ports, so clearly the Surface wins here. The Macbook Pro does have HDMI, which is nice, but I just bought a USB-C to HDMI cable that I carry around with me, so I don't need a dongle for that either.-Keyboard: I like that the Macbook Air has more than 3 levels of brightness control, but I slightly prefer the key feel on the Surface.- Trackpad: somehow, the Surface's trackpad is better. I am thrilled that Microsoft finally brought a haptic trackpad to the Surface lineup. It feels more delicate and the tactility is stronger. Macbook trackpads are still among the best in the business, but there is finally a Windows laptop that is comparable in this regard.-Login: hands down, Windows Hello is better than the fingerprint reader. It's so fast that my Surface often logs me that it feels like the laptop was left unlocked. The fingerprint scanner on Macbooks are very good, but they are not as fast, nor as convenient, as Windows Hello. My Macbook Pro could also unlock with my Apple Watch, but that almost always took longer than unlocking with my finger.-Build Quality: This has always been a strong point for Surface devices, and the Surface Laptop 7 doesn't disappoint. The laptop can be opened easily with one hand, and the fit and finish is flawless. The same is true of the Macbook Air. I can't say whether one is better than the other. The Surface is designed to be easier to service, however, and you can actually replace the SSD, which is very nice. Additionally, the black finish on my Surface is more resistant to showing fingerprints than the dark blue on the Macbook Airs, which is a fingerprint magnet.-Performance: After owning an Apple Silicon laptop, I could never go back to using an x86/x64 processor. I used Windows 11 for ARM on my Macbook for two years virtualized in Paralells, so I knew what I was getting into. All of the applications I need work beautifully on the Surface, and it is so darn fast. Of course, there are more powerful processors out there using traditional x64 architecture, but I have never used a Windows laptop that is just so snappy for every day tasks. Office apps open in 1-2 seconds. Firefox, Chrome, and Edge open in less than a second. Using gestures to swipe through apps is super snappy, and the high refresh rate screen makes transitions look so smooth. This is the kind of performance I came to except from my Apple Silicon Macbook, and it's wonderful to finally see Windows operating just as responsively.Overall, the Surface feels like an upgrade over my Macbook Pro, and I personally am fine with the tradeoffs that come with the thinner, smaller, and lighter Surface over the more powerful Macbook Pro. It is an utterly fantastic laptop that, in my opinion, is currently the best thin-and-light laptop in the world.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "This incredible, beautiful, elegant and productive laptop showcases what Microsoft is truly capable of, and I'm a Linux guy. I bought the big one - 15\" screen, 32 gig RAM, elite CPU. It is a powerhouse of a laptop.Now - there is one con, but as time progresses the problem becomes less and less of a problem and that is the ARM architecture vs standard Intel x86/64. Basically, this laptop uses a newer, different CPU architecture, which means that many applications don't work yet (YET!!). Almost everything I threw at this laptop worked out of the box and worked beautifully. There were some older applications that didn't work (SimCity Deluxe for example). But and this is a huge BUT - as time passes more applications are supported (or emulated effectively) and it becomes less and less an issue.With the 1 CON out of the way, let's talk about how amazing this laptop is:Premium feel (shell and keyboard). As good as or even better than a MacBook. Yes, for real.Speakers sound delightful.The 15\"-inch sounds like a big laptop but fits perfectly in my backpack and it is still light and small. I mean, unless you are a 5'2\" petite tiny person I don't see how this 15\" laptop is too big for someone.It is plenty fast for doing all sorts of productivity like writing papers, excel spreadsheeting, music, internet, YouTube etc. Understand this isn't a fancy Chromebook. Operating System / Applications are exceptionally fast. This laptop WILL make you more productive just by opening it. It makes you want to work it's so nice.Battery life is OUTSTANDING. If you aren't glued to this laptop for hours at a time the battery will last DAYS. Literally days.Touchpad is also legit. No problems with cursor moving around (palm detection) and typing. Just legit good.Even when watching movies it doesn't get hot. Temperature is steady and cool. I love ARM.In closing, get this laptop. It's nice. Really nice. Like honestly, the nicest laptop I've ever owned (I've had the ASUS ROG 2024, two Dell XPS 15's, Razer Blades, etc.,)For my fellow nerds in the crowd:VMWare & Vbox do NOT work. Remember that ARM is a RISC architecture and neither products support ARM (yet). Docker Desktop for Windows DOES work on ARM. Also, WSL 2.0 also works just fine.Also, with the advent of cloud, lightweight servers (I run a small cloud on my home network) we don't need powerhouse laptops anymore if you have supporting infra. When I'm on travel I just VPN into my home network and I have all the resources I need. So keep something light and portable to work from :)\n  \nRead more",

It also handles emulation up to the PS2(most games*)/PSP like a champ (many ARM versions exist for emulators now too, so thats a plus!)Honestly, microsoft did good here. You can still run traditional exes built for x86/x64 and it will emulate the instructions to ARM (very cool) and it runs native ARM executables.I'm not a huge fan of its dedicated weird charging port... and I had to get a stronger usb cable for charging and a stronger battery bank that supported the wattage required for this thing to even recognize it as a charger for whatever reason.. But otherwise good.\n  \nRead more",

After it was it returned it get locking up on restart. Didn't know if it hardware compatibility problems so I went thru one by one eliminated those which meant wiping PC clean and restarting from USB boot drive and reloading. The I starting eliminating software. Finally found that the problem was restoring Pictures and Music files from backup hard drives. Apparently the ARM takes a long time to actually finish copying the data to the C: drive and I was restarting before it was finished. Even though the dialog box shows that process is complete it is still running in the background and it takes like 30 minutes or more to finish copying everything over.  I checked the properties of the input folders to the output and they were the same but the process was still running in the background.  What's the point of a fast processor is it runs like an old XP PC? I would have returned the PC but my return date was 3/3/2025 and when I got all this figured out I was a day late!\n  \nRead more",

I own one of each of the first three editions of the Go (Go 1 w/10.1\"; and the 10.5\" Go 2 and Go 3). The latest Go 4 is sold through business channels only and hasn't shown up on any used websites yet.What I like (and don't like) about all the Go's:* Killer screen resolution and quality, definitely Amazon Prime-worthy. In settings, I increase the normal display from 150% to 175% for easier reading. You will want to stick with 150% if you have sharp vision and want to split the screen into two windows (I treat my Go's like an iPad, one full window at a time, and just switch windows to cut and paste or see another active program.* Infrared and visible light (camera) combine for highly secure facial scan log-ins. Microsoft wisely recommends using a PIN, custom password for this device, or the facial login so peepers (visual surveillance in real time or through security cameras) can't capture your Microsoft account log-in details. I find the system the the Surface uses to be the most trustworthy (imho equal to Apple facial recognitionand far superior to Android)* Front firing stereo speakers with good clarity (out of tiny slits on the left and right upper corners). Much better than Apple iPad's side-firing edge speakers.* Centrally located front and rear cameras, a good location for video calls. However, in my experience, the iPad 9 and 10 have a far superior microprocessor that provides much better video quality without stuttering. This isn't Microsoft's fault, it's Intel for falling so far behind Apple's in-house design custom chips. At least Microsoft got the camera lens locations perfect from day one, compared to Apple's awkward location on the middle of the side edge (until the iPad 10).* Anti-fall recharging - Microsoft uses a magnetically clamping on power connector that won't yank the table to the floor if you trip on the power cable. It also uses POGO conductive \"dots\" which means there is no \"port\" (plug hole) to get mangled over time and leave you unable to charge your tablet.* The single USB C port WILL also charge the tablet; in fact the Apple 18 watt C and Anker 18 or 20 watt C, chargers will easily re-charge the Surface Go even while you use it.* Screen shape is optimized for full-screen windows, with plenty of width for a normal typewriter page, and extra height compared to the wide angle screens on Android tablets and on most Windows and Chrome laptops. It is the same \"aspect ratio\" as it's bigger brothers, the Surface Pro's.* THAT BUILT-IN KICKSTAND. I've been waiting for years for a kickstand on the iPads, which I also love. First, you don't need an accessory case or cover so you can prop up the tablet on a desk or counter; all you need to do is fold out the kickstand. Second, if is VERY stable unlike an iPad screen cover folded to the rear into a little unstable triangle. And, unlike the iPad case covers and screen covers, you have a wide variety of viewing angles - continuously variable, not just a few clickable positions.* The factor keyboard requires no charging. The factory keyboard is illuminated. No \"pairing\" is required because the hinge on the factory keyboard magnetically snaps on to the bottom edge of the tablet and directly connects via the conductive POGO dots on the tablet and spikes on the keyboard.* There are more than 4  accessory keyboards to choose from. I have used Arteck, Inateck, and Omoton and they are all satisfactory - snap on magnetically just like the factory keyboard, but pair using Buetooth. The Omoton is preferred, in addition to being backlighted, it recharges with a C cable, instead of the now-obsolete Micro USB - so one less cable and perhaps one less charger (modern charges are C on both ends, the transition era of A on the charger and C on the cable end are over, although A=>C is how Amazon still ships their Fire tablets).* The clip-on accessory keyboards also cover and protect the screen while in transit.* On this Go TWO only (plus the later two models), the margins around the screen are narrower than on the Go 1, and the screen is .4\" bigger.* The Go's all accept Micro SD cards, and you can go into settings and change the default file locations from the small 64gb internal storage (typically 11gb-25gb available) to the Micro SD card; I use a 256gb Samsung at $18 from Amazon for this purpose (I can only recommend Samsung, Patriot, and Sandisk). I strongly recommend Samsung, just look for A1 or A2 class for better performance, it doesn't run fast then slow down as it heats up, unlike some competitors.* ONLY THE Go 2-Go 4 RUN WINDOWS 11. This is critical since Microsoft is discontinuing security updates for Windows 10 at the end of this year.* Microsoft's current support for Word's online only version is superb; I no longer have to download either the shorter app version or longer full-version.*eMMC vs SSD vs EFS - the Go 1-3 models with 64gb hard drives use eMMC storage, which is a souped up micro SD card system. The Go 1-3 models with 128gb and up hard drives use full laptop and desktop grade SSD's. The Go 4 models, regardless of storage capacity, use UFS, which is  super-souped up micro SD card system. Supposedly, EFS is almost as fast as a low-end SSD but uses less power and takes up less space. According to test reports, the Go 1-3 with SSD's installed had way faster bulk file transfer speeds, and because they can read/write at the same time, better results in other key areas of performance. HOWEVER in typical use scenarios - YouTube, Spotify, writing - there was no subjective difference in performance.* There are some good deals on Amazon Renewed Surface Go 2's. A lot of companies and some schools use Go's instead of iPads, and close them out on regular cycles. It's not time for inexpensive Go 3's yet. In most cases, if you purchase a used Go 2, it will be a business model and will boot into Pro Windows (although you will need to manually update (by clicking a button) to Windows 11).Let's hit some negatives:* 64gb can end up with 11gb or so left for working space, if you go through all the updates after purchase (including updating to Windows 11). While the operating system is set to erase no-longer needed files monthly, I go into Settings=>Sytem=> Storage and click on Temporary Files and manually delete \"Prior Windows Installations\" to get my available storage back up to 25-30gb.* Multiple browsers eat up storage. I use just Edge and DuckDuckGo browsers; Edge is pre-installed, DuckDuckGo is either on the Microsoft Store or web.* I recommend charging separately. If I charge while using it, it develops a hot spot all the way across the top half. Intel really has some catching up to do with Apple and Android/ARM/Chromebooks on ARM in terms of heat and battery life.* Battery life is as little as 4 hours while watching YouTube or streaming services (as much as 7 hours on Google Docs or Microsoft Word online).* There's no such thing as a simple screen cover. It's keyboard cover, or hit the road jack.Recommendations.+ If you find the right size Dockem, a simple but very useful envelope style protetive cover, they work very well. You have to oversize them properly to allow for the keyboard cover. I suggest measuring things but add .5\" to the size Dockem specs show; or get the next size up from iPad Pro 11 size. Of course you can cheap out and use an Amazon shipping bubble envelope instead, which is more low key through TSA and has your name and address on it for I.D.+ It's a touch screen, but even for videos I use the trackpad on the keyboard so I'm not always get finger print smudges.+ If it's only $30-50 more, 128gb is a more relaxed way to go.+ The built-in security software is very good imho; in 20 years I've stuck with it. However go into Security Settings and make sure Device Security is turned on in hardware options, and make sure you have Enhanced Hardware Security active.+ Don't give up if the initial setup and security updates and upgrade to Windows 11 seems to take forever; it does. Just do it on the kitchen counter while you do other stuff and otherwise respond to its occasional pleas for inputs from you. It is NOT as efficient as updating an iPad. But only the first experience is so bad it hurts. Thereafter, pretty painless+ Your reward is the most compatible operating system on the planet. With iPads and even Chromebooks, sometimes I want to pull my hair out with weird webpage glitches. Never with Windows.\n  \nRead more",

It seemed at first to be in excellent condition until I took off my sunglasses, that’s when I noticed the scuff mark in the body and some type of tacky residue on the back. I’ve cleaned off the tacky residue, which was only in a couple spots, but discovered the scuff since I couldn’t clean it off. This was sold as Refurbished Excellent and it clearly isn’t in excellent condition and some money should be credited back.Update: While using this today, it wasn’t hot as it was normal use on Internet, the screen flickered showing scrambled multi color vertical lines for less than a second each time. Obviously, if they had actually checked this item they would’ve definitely known it isn’t excellent condition. I’m obviously returning this item, shipped tomorrow. I attempted to reset to factory but the seller messed up the Windows 11 install and files were missing so I couldn’t reset to factory; I had to download a factory image from Microsoft which restored it to Windows 10. Upon completing the restore it asked for a login for Livonia Public Schools. I contacted the IT department at the school for a generic login and the following is the email I received back…I'm not sure who you bought this from on Amazon, but I would contact them and return the device. We were not paid for these and the recycler did not have our permission to resell these devices.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I had originally purchased an off brand tablet for about 100 dollars less than this one. As you would expect, it was garbage. It was slow, unreliable and just a perfect example of why buying \"Chinese off brand\" products is hit or miss.When I got my Surface (a full 7 days earlier than expected) I was absolutely blow away by the difference 100 dollars made. It arrived looking absolutely brand new. Honestly, the seller probably could have passed it off as new if they chose to.Setup was pretty straightforward, it runs Windows 10 and it's set to the desktop version so if you have a PC or laptop running Win10, there's almost no learning curve.The speakers are great considering the size of the tablet. Crisp clear sounds. I doubt I'll use it much for video but it's nice to know I can. The screen is clear and easy to read. The touch screen function might take a little getting used to as the OS isn't designed around that aspect, but it's not a big deal. Worst case scenario you can easily use a bluetooth mouse/keyboard.I can't comment on the battery life yet, but so far it doesn't seem like it'll be much of an issue.I bought this primarily for use in a course I'm taking so mostly word processing and web searching, and I don't forsee any issues in that regard.All said and done, buying refurbished electronics can be a little daunting at times, but I'm 100 percent happy with this particular purchase as well as the seller.\n  \nRead more",

It just seems like charging is such a basic function  I don’t know how the hell it was the thing that was missed by these “experts”.Edit: Best Buy are the real hero’s here. Was able to get the problem diagnosed. Amazon wouldn’t even send me a replacement charger, even tho it was established the initial one was faulty. So much for a warranty.Over all good price- but you might spend a little more time and money covering for amazons “experts”\n  \nRead more",

I will be purchasing another one very shortly.  The unit was described as being in excellent condition and other than it not being in the original box, I cannot tell it from brand new.  I would definitely not hesitate especially with the savings over a brand-new unit.  I do not game but use primarily for keeping finances, spreadsheets, family tree etc.\n  \nRead more",

I'm a mid-life adult using it for web browsing, light excel and streaming video. All work great. I plan to use this for at least 5 years.Can't beat it for the price.

It's a Surface Pro 6, so it doesn't have the newer USB-C connection - but that's fine for me, as I find USB-A just a little more convenient (bearing in mind that this isn't a primary computer for my family, but a casual tablet).Also, please note the price - I got this for a mite under $500, which makes it exceptional value today (early 2020), blowing the ~$400 Surface Go out of the water.Mine was \"renewed\" from Mastertronics, and everything looked good. The box had some rather large stickerage on it to make it clear it was renewed. Out of the box it wanted to run first-time W10 setup. After that, checking the battery showed that it had been cycled seven times already (good! Not EXCELLENT, but good!).There's not really much else to say that hasn't been covered by countless SP6 reviews. These renewed ones come without the excellent Type Cover or stylus, it's worth noting. It's a lovely, premium-feeling slab of tablet, without being too heavy (I can't even feel it in my backpack when it goes there in place of my ~2.1KG Acer R7-571 laptop). Battery life is good. So... that's it! $500 is such a bargain for a quality little machine like this, and in my case, the \"renewed\" version was completely problem-free.\n  \nRead more",

Also, the processor was not an I5 8400T.  While using windows, the brown spots turned into white spots and it was very annoying and unbearable to look at. We looked up troubleshooting tips to see if it was something that can be reset. It was recommended on Microsoft site to enter into UEFI mode and if the issue appears there, then it points to screen damage. We unfortunately did not take pictures and decided to have it replaced as the listing from Amazon does say it was eligible for a refund or replacement.We tried to setup an exchange but it told us that our product was not eligible for a return and that we had to contact Amazon. We did so and they informed us we had to return it an order another. Well that is not an exchange but a return. So what is the point of advertising that they offer the ability to exchange? We called back and a supervisor was able to setup the exchange. So we shipped back the item, same day, and a few days later, received the second Surface. WellllllCosmetically it was in worse shape then the first. But we were really not that upset about the exterior and it was going in a case anyway. However, we turned it on and was greeted to the exact same type of burn in white/brown spots (this time we took pictures, albeit not AS bad, but still very noticeable. This time we did the same things as the first unit and just went through windows setup and check to see if its working at all which lead to the next big problem with this unit, the touch screen was messed up. This is going to be kind of hard to show in pictures/video but the top part of the screen does not respond to touch inputs. So I used the tool to calibrate the touch and pen inputs and to no luck, it did not fix it. As someone who will be using this as a tablet more then a laptop, this was way more impossible to overlook then the burn in spots. Now that nothing about this product was in Excellent condition as described in the listing, we at least checked to make sure the specs are correct and things are running correctly to find that the CPU in our unit was not as the one described once again. This time the CPU was an i5-8350U.I would completely understand if the first unit we got was messed up and that mistakes happen or that this unit unfortunately got damaged in shipping, however the 2nd unit being messed up in the same exact manner raises a lot of questions and suspicion. I have a very hard time believing that this company is refurbishing these units when the first step after working on the product should be to turn on the unit and make sure everything is working.

A tip of the hat to Amazon for at least grading each renewed item into one of three categories. I chose to purchase the top category which is \"Excellent Condition,\" and indeed it is. The Surface 6 that I received is like new in every way except the packaging. The packaging is very good, but not the original box. Most importantly, the Surface 6 works perfectly and I cannot find even one small scratch on it. Your mileage may vary, but I think if you stick with \"excellent condition'\" then you'll be well satisfied. If not, you can take advantage of Amazon's generous return policy.\n  \nRead more",

I am returning the second one for an uncomfortably degraded battery, which came with 570+ cycles, and drained excessively fast.I feel like I am being asked to take on an unreasonably high risk of unpredictable battery issues for a refurbished item described as excellent. I am told many other vendors would hesitate to ship a battery in this condition, and it would be good practice to disclose more information to prospective buyers.Buyers may wish to generate their own battery report for refurbished laptops purchasing using command: powercfg /battery report.\n  \nRead more",

I did a lot of research and watched many YouTube videos.  I have a Surface Pro 4 which served me well for many years, but hands down this unit blows it away. I paid $1000.00 for it new.

Since I am a registered owner of Windows 10, it latched onto my Win10 license and used it as an upgrade. My Win 11 product key is unused, bonus! So far I haven't experienced any issues or errors. With the SSD, from power on to login screen is 7 seconds! Amazing. Not wild about the PIN instead of a password thing. Still exploring the new features, so I may update my review in the future. All in all, happy with the product so far.Update: A month and a half in, still working as advertised. Maybe M$ finally got an OS correct lol\n  \nRead more",

It is a pain and unless you are using it for an application where you have IT support you likely don’t need one.The PC is dying despite the advantages of its form factor and it is all Microsoft’s fault. They got a monopoly then used the power to make the user experience worse with every edition since at least Windows 7 and probably Windows XP remains the high point for Windows.The process of setting it up should be Microsoft’s chance to shine. Make a good first impression by having a product that just works. Instead you are stuck wasting time because you don’t have hardwired internet and have to lug the computer to the router. Then it doesn’t want to let you install without a Microsoft account. Then you buy the kids a game, and of course it remembers your credit card so they can easily order whatever they want without asking for the card. Not even a the dignity of a check box to not remember the card!The only consolation of a painful few hours setting up a computer is that this horrible user experience has driven the PC into collapse. I asked my wife if she wanted one along with my kids and while she had one for years in the bright days of Windows XP, she didn’t really care to get off her phone long enough to use a computer.\n  \nRead more",

                "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    4 Stars vs Surface Pro series, but as the smallest, least expensive Surface, it is 5 Stars",
                "review": "I'm a big fan of both the 12.3\" Surface Pro (note: current screens are a little larger) and of the mini-me Go lineup. I own one of each of the first three editions of the Go (Go 1 w/10.1\"; and the 10.5\" Go 2 and Go 3). The latest Go 4 is sold through business channels only and hasn't shown up on any used websites yet.What I like (and don't like) about all the Go's:* Killer screen resolution and quality, definitely Amazon Prime-worthy. In settings, I increase the normal display from 150% to 175% for easier reading. You will want to stick with 150% if you have sharp vision and want to split the screen into two windows (I treat my Go's like an iPad, one full window at a time, and just switch windows to cut and paste or see another active program.* Infrared and visible light (camera) combine for highly secure facial scan log-ins. Microsoft wisely recommends using a PIN, custom password for this device, or the facial login so peepers (visual surveillance in real time or through security cameras) can't capture your Microsoft account log-in details. I find the system the the Surface uses to be the most trustworthy (imho equal to Apple facial recognitionand far superior to Android)* Front firing stereo speakers with good clarity (out of tiny slits on the left and right upper corners). Much better than Apple iPad's side-firing edge speakers.* Centrally located front and rear cameras, a good location for video calls. However, in my experience, the iPad 9 and 10 have a far superior microprocessor that provides much better video quality without stuttering. This isn't Microsoft's fault, it's Intel for falling so far behind Apple's in-house design custom chips. At least Microsoft got the camera lens locations perfect from day one, compared to Apple's awkward location on the middle of the side edge (until the iPad 10).* Anti-fall recharging - Microsoft uses a magnetically clamping on power connector that won't yank the table to the floor if you trip on the power cable. It also uses POGO conductive \"dots\" which means there is no \"port\" (plug hole) to get mangled over time and leave you unable to charge your tablet.* The single USB C port WILL also charge the tablet; in fact the Apple 18 watt C and Anker 18 or 20 watt C, chargers will easily re-charge the Surface Go even while you use it.* Screen shape is optimized for full-screen windows, with plenty of width for a normal typewriter page, and extra height compared to the wide angle screens on Android tablets and on most Windows and Chrome laptops. It is the same \"aspect ratio\" as it's bigger brothers, the Surface Pro's.* THAT BUILT-IN KICKSTAND. I've been waiting for years for a kickstand on the iPads, which I also love. First, you don't need an accessory case or cover so you can prop up the tablet on a desk or counter; all you need to do is fold out the kickstand. Second, if is VERY stable unlike an iPad screen cover folded to the rear into a little unstable triangle. And, unlike the iPad case covers and screen covers, you have a wide variety of viewing angles - continuously variable, not just a few clickable positions.* The factor keyboard requires no charging. The factory keyboard is illuminated. No \"pairing\" is required because the hinge on the factory keyboard magnetically snaps on to the bottom edge of the tablet and directly connects via the conductive POGO dots on the tablet and spikes on the keyboard.* There are more than 4  accessory keyboards to choose from. I have used Arteck, Inateck, and Omoton and they are all satisfactory - snap on magnetically just like the factory keyboard, but pair using Buetooth. The Omoton is preferred, in addition to being backlighted, it recharges with a C cable, instead of the now-obsolete Micro USB - so one less cable and perhaps one less charger (modern charges are C on both ends, the transition era of A on the charger and C on the cable end are over, although A=>C is how Amazon still ships their Fire tablets).* The clip-on accessory keyboards also cover and protect the screen while in transit.* On this Go TWO only (plus the later two models), the margins around the screen are narrower than on the Go 1, and the screen is .4\" bigger.* The Go's all accept Micro SD cards, and you can go into settings and change the default file locations from the small 64gb internal storage (typically 11gb-25gb available) to the Micro SD card; I use a 256gb Samsung at $18 from Amazon for this purpose (I can only recommend Samsung, Patriot, and Sandisk). I strongly recommend Samsung, just look for A1 or A2 class for better performance, it doesn't run fast then slow down as it heats up, unlike some competitors.* ONLY THE Go 2-Go 4 RUN WINDOWS 11. This is critical since Microsoft is discontinuing security updates for Windows 10 at the end of this year.* Microsoft's current support for Word's online only version is superb; I no longer have to download either the shorter app version or longer full-version.*eMMC vs SSD vs EFS - the Go 1-3 models with 64gb hard drives use eMMC storage, which is a souped up micro SD card system. The Go 1-3 models with 128gb and up hard drives use full laptop and desktop grade SSD's. The Go 4 models, regardless of storage capacity, use UFS, which is  super-souped up micro SD card system. Supposedly, EFS is almost as fast as a low-end SSD but uses less power and takes up less space. According to test reports, the Go 1-3 with SSD's installed had way faster bulk file transfer speeds, and because they can read/write at the same time, better results in other key areas of performance. HOWEVER in typical use scenarios - YouTube, Spotify, writing - there was no subjective difference in performance.* There are some good deals on Amazon Renewed Surface Go 2's. A lot of companies and some schools use Go's instead of iPads, and close them out on regular cycles. It's not time for inexpensive Go 3's yet. In most cases, if you purchase a used Go 2, it will be a business model and will boot into Pro Windows (although you will need to manually update (by clicking a button) to Windows 11).Let's hit some negatives:* 64gb can end up with 11gb or so left for working space, if you go through all the updates after purchase (including updating to Windows 11). While the operating system is set to erase no-longer needed files monthly, I go into Settings=>Sytem=> Storage and click on Temporary Files and manually delete \"Prior Windows Installations\" to get my available storage back up to 25-30gb.* Multiple browsers eat up storage. I use just Edge and DuckDuckGo browsers; Edge is pre-installed, DuckDuckGo is either on the Microsoft Store or web.* I recommend charging separately. If I charge while using it, it develops a hot spot all the way across the top half. Intel really has some catching up to do with Apple and Android/ARM/Chromebooks on ARM in terms of heat and battery life.* Battery life is as little as 4 hours while watching YouTube or streaming services (as much as 7 hours on Google Docs or Microsoft Word online).* There's no such thing as a simple screen cover. It's keyboard cover, or hit the road jack.Recommendations.+ If you find the right size Dockem, a simple but very useful envelope style protetive cover, they work very well. You have to oversize them properly to allow for the keyboard cover. I suggest measuring things but add .5\" to the size Dockem specs show; or get the next size up from iPad Pro 11 size. Of course you can cheap out and use an Amazon shipping bubble envelope instead, which is more low key through TSA and has your name and address on it for I.D.+ It's a touch screen, but even for videos I use the trackpad on the keyboard so I'm not always get finger print smudges.+ If it's only $30-50 more, 128gb is a more relaxed way to go.+ The built-in security software is very good imho; in 20 years I've stuck with it. However go into Security Settings and make sure Device Security is turned on in hardware options, and make sure you have Enhanced Hardware Security active.+ Don't give up if the initial setup and security updates and upgrade to Windows 11 seems to take forever; it does. Just do it on the kitchen counter while you do other stuff and otherwise respond to its occasional pleas for inputs from you. It is NOT as efficient as updating an iPad. But only the first experience is so bad it hurts. Thereafter, pretty painless+ Your reward is the most compatible operating system on the planet. With iPads and even Chromebooks, sometimes I want to pull my hair out with weird webpage glitches. Never with Windows.\n  \nRead more",

I sooke to cs and they sent me a replacement that also does not charge via c port charger. You need an outlet or AC plug battery pack if you want to charge this when you are on the road. I returned the replacemnt and kept my original order.The battery on this product lasted me more than 8 hours on a full charge with constant use. Which was good.I liked the size and the functionality.I biught a keyboard as my clients sometimes uses the keyboard during signing . I am a mobile notary.\n  \nRead more",

It seemed at first to be in excellent condition until I took off my sunglasses, that’s when I noticed the scuff mark in the body and some type of tacky residue on the back. I’ve cleaned off the tacky residue, which was only in a couple spots, but discovered the scuff since I couldn’t clean it off. This was sold as Refurbished Excellent and it clearly isn’t in excellent condition and some money should be credited back.Update: While using this today, it wasn’t hot as it was normal use on Internet, the screen flickered showing scrambled multi color vertical lines for less than a second each time. Obviously, if they had actually checked this item they would’ve definitely known it isn’t excellent condition. I’m obviously returning this item, shipped tomorrow. I attempted to reset to factory but the seller messed up the Windows 11 install and files were missing so I couldn’t reset to factory; I had to download a factory image from Microsoft which restored it to Windows 10. Upon completing the restore it asked for a login for Livonia Public Schools. I contacted the IT department at the school for a generic login and the following is the email I received back…I'm not sure who you bought this from on Amazon, but I would contact them and return the device. We were not paid for these and the recycler did not have our permission to resell these devices.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I had originally purchased an off brand tablet for about 100 dollars less than this one. As you would expect, it was garbage. It was slow, unreliable and just a perfect example of why buying \"Chinese off brand\" products is hit or miss.When I got my Surface (a full 7 days earlier than expected) I was absolutely blow away by the difference 100 dollars made. It arrived looking absolutely brand new. Honestly, the seller probably could have passed it off as new if they chose to.Setup was pretty straightforward, it runs Windows 10 and it's set to the desktop version so if you have a PC or laptop running Win10, there's almost no learning curve.The speakers are great considering the size of the tablet. Crisp clear sounds. I doubt I'll use it much for video but it's nice to know I can. The screen is clear and easy to read. The touch screen function might take a little getting used to as the OS isn't designed around that aspect, but it's not a big deal. Worst case scenario you can easily use a bluetooth mouse/keyboard.I can't comment on the battery life yet, but so far it doesn't seem like it'll be much of an issue.I bought this primarily for use in a course I'm taking so mostly word processing and web searching, and I don't forsee any issues in that regard.All said and done, buying refurbished electronics can be a little daunting at times, but I'm 100 percent happy with this particular purchase as well as the seller.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I really like this Surface Pro 7. It is exactly as advertised with one exception. The battery life is nowhere near what is advertised. On battery saving mode, using only Onenote for taking class notes, it lasts about 4 hours. Fortunately it charges up very quickly though. I can't see any way that I would get a full days use out of a full battery charge in any circumstance. In my case that is not very important because I am always around an outlet but if you need a tablet that will last all day away from a power source you will have a problem. The camera is good enough, not as good as the Apple camera, but I don't really use it as a camera anyway. I use mostly the 365 programs and find that it integrates these programs seamlessly. Onenote comes with the tablet and has been an amazing app for my vet school classes.  It saves my many hours of study time. My only issues are with the instability of Onenote. It closes itself down every few minutes and is very frustrating. I'm sure there is a fix for this but I'm also sure that I won't get it from Microsorft as they have a technical support team that is on par with the customer service team at the cable company. I've contacted them 3 times now and my issue is never addressed. I was actually told to contact Amazon since they sold it to me. It seems like after spending a thousand dollars on Microsoft products they would at least provide a bit of tech support.  I'll just have to scour the web for a fix to this I guess. Overall I would recommend this tablet to every student. It seems to be a fantastic and fast machine.\n  \nRead more",

                "title": "1.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Don’t buy the surface pro 7 from amazon",
                "review": "Well where do i start..... i ended up getting my item and everything was good for about 20mins of use... however after 20mins my screen would freeze for 10-30 secs. I blew it off at first but then it happen 10mins after then it became a often issue. So i ended up going for an exchange. (The worst idea I’ve ever had). I called up amazon and told them my issue and they were quick to get me a replacement so as first i was satisfied until the surface pro 7 came in the next day. I open the box to find out the box it comes in is not only damage but in a renewed box didn’t even come in the same box it should have come in, then i open that to see the surface pro and the screen film wrapped around it was really dirty as if they dropped it in dirt or so and fingerprints all over the machine. So at this point I’m just hoping it works. This one was not charged at all at 15% like it usually is if you were to buy from Microsoft or an apple device would normally be. So i put it on the charger to find out that it not only has screen tear straight down the middle of the screen but a big red dot half the size of the screen was on there as if they drop the surface pro. So at this point i immediately call amazon and i talked to a representative that ended up giving me a hard time about another replacement even though this one was obviously there fault. So i ended up talking to a supervisor that ended up giving me a hard time as well and in the she said to me that they only do a exchange once but as a one time exception they’ll do the exchange to which i responded with i only want to do the exchange if it’s a brand new product that they are giving me not a renewed one and undamaged. To which she agreed that she would make sure it would be done and put in her notes so the wear house  knows. Well the next day came and guess what.... the man that drops it off throws my package at the wall of my house from a big distance he didn’t see me at all so when i raced over the man jumped in his car and quickly drove away knowing what he did. Not only this but when i open the box the surface pro again was in a dirty renewed box, at this point I’m just hoping it still even worked again no power so i plug it in and guess what it works surprisingly after all that. However i Notice something was different with the boot up process so i knew something was wrong i go to the setting of the computer and the version i bought was 8gb of ram i5 model with 128gb of memory the one i receive as a replacement this time was a 4gb version i5 model with 128gb of memory and GUESS WHAT A DIFFERENT GRAPHICS CARD AS WELL. The surface pro 7 i got not only had 4gb of ram which was wrong but a different graphics card as well that comes in a surface pro 5 are you serious.... so i called up customer service again asking for a supervisor yet again..... just wanting a refund the man told me well i see here that you have a couple of exchange for this device already so i told him this story i am telling now and ask him i wonder why i have “a couple of exchanges” to which he said well instead of a refund i can get you a brand new one and told me how he had to make a couple of phone calls to do this for me so i told him this is the last exchange I’ll be getting ill be asking for a refund next like i previously wanted..if the next one comes in the renewed box which that would mean it’s used.. if it’s broken or the wrong model I’m done with trying and I’m done with the surface pro 7. not only was this the worst experience with amazon that I’ve ever had and worst costumer Service but now I’m going to hate the surface pro 7 because of this. I’ll see what i receive next as of 02/23/2020Sorry for the long review but i felt my experience should be shared for others to see.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "My previous laptop was a godzilla, 15 inch monitor, weighs like 3 pounds or something (2014 model). I was looking for something that had the horsepower for what I needed, but also the lightness to carry it around. Although battery life isnt, the best, I DON'T MIND!This thing is a beast! Im very happy running programs like tableau, zoom, excel, powerpoint, all at the same time and with various files and this thing doesn't even flinch. The first few hours setting up and downloading all the programs it felt a big sluggish and I was starting to get worried. Once that was done, it started to fly.Yes, the rotating screen isnt as flawless as apple's iPad. That said, I bought this not to look pretty, i bought it to be my tool in battle. Being able to run all the programs that a regular PC can run is the main decision I went for Microsoft Surface.  The only downside is that Microsoft is a bit costly on the accessories front.I recommend this piece of tech to anyone who needs to travel or is on the move.  I'm a relatively big guy and i've had no major problem with the size of the keyboard. I do put it FLAT on tables because my keystrokes tend to be pretty hard and the keyboard is the most (in my opinion) fragile of the accessories.Lastly, the Pen interface is not perfect YET but oh man, as a first timer working with it, it kicks total ass and makes note taking in OneNote a complete positive trip.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I am a student-teacher. As such I have to take notes, as well as make lessons for students. This device is fantastic for note-taking and creating documents for schools. The screen is beautiful, and while I wish the bezels were as slim as they were on the surface pro x, I think the bezels are still fine and you tend not to notice them when you're using the device. With a resolution of 2736x1824 (yes, it's a weird resolution) on a 12.3 screen, everything is tack sharp and it has good colour accuracy. I do have a screen calibration tool and did notice quite the difference after calibrating it, but most people will be fine with the base settings.I wouldn't recommend getting the base model (i3 and 4GB ram) since let's be honest, a 4GB ram shouldn't even exist at this point. I think the i5 is the sweet spot, since the i7 isn't really that much better, along with whatever storage option you think you'd need. I'm okay with 256GB. Also, note it does have expandable storage via a micro SD card up to 1TB. The performance on this device is also great about 95% of the time. I get a few weird issues and stutters from time to time, but that is most likely due to windows being windows.The weakest point of this device would definitely be the battery life. While there are worse options out there, I do wish that the battery was slightly better. Having a lot of virtual meetings given the pandemic requires a lot of webcam use and multitasking, and I find that after a couple of hours the battery is already around 30% - with battery-saving mode enabled. When you're not doing that, and you're doing just standard web-browsing and media consumption, you'll be looking at a solid 5-6 hours minimum at acceptable brightness levels.Another negative is that while yes, this device is great, but if you want the full experience, you still have to purchase the type cover, which is another $150+ and the surface pen, which is another $100. So keep in mind that whatever option you choose, you're going to be spending another $300 after taxes.Overall though, writing notes on this device is fantastic, especially if you already use Microsoft 365. I think you can get by with the battery life, and you won't be disappointed by the performance unless you are a heavy user.\n  \nRead more",

Esteticamente es una joya, se maneja muy facil al tacto.Si bien no es de uso rudo, es decir con programas para programación, pesados o para gamers no creo que sea lo mejor, pero para un uso de oficina, paquete de office, internet correos vida diaria funciona a la perfección. La bateria rinde bien y la carga con USB - C le da una ventaja brutal (evidentemente no con un cargador de celular, si no con el de una mac o con el nintendo switch, carga bastante bien). Muy contento con este equipo, esteticamente repito que es una joya aunque si se ve fragil y es preferible una case que ya lo hacen que la puedas cargar donde quieras.\n  \n  \nRead more",

The only problem is the included AC adapter is bad…luckily i had an adapter from the computer I was replacing. I used the poor Amazons chat customer service to let them know the PC worked but the ac adapter was bad, and all I needed was a replacement ac adapter. They said ok, a day later I get a approved refund request which I never asked for, all I need is the ac adapter for the computer, no reason the seller should have to replace the entire pc. I needed a pc since mine died, otherwise I wouldn’t have ordered it, I don’t want a refund. If the only way to get a replacement adapter through Amazons poor customer service is to replace the entire computer I’ll just go without and leave a bad review. I am happy to update this bad review if seller can resolve the issue that Amazon has actually made worse.\n  \nRead more",

I need this tablet for school, and I couldn't possibly use this in class as it would be a huge noise distraction. I adjusted the battery to recommended setting, updated, and restarted all like 3 times. Nothing worked. It's going back to this shady company, and I will not purchase anything from them again. They clearly cannot QA/QC...or they just don't care. Huge waste of my time.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "If you want Windows on a beater tablet in the year 2025 this is the way to go. You absolutely want 8 GB of ram and the Core M3 chip to get a half way fluid desktop experience. The 4gb and Pentium gold version functions but it chokes so much even webbrowsing while downloading updates is janky and that makes it hard to use as a \"normal computer\". 128 GB is really also what you need as the 64gb version will have so much space taken up by windows, windows install files and hybernation files you will have to constantly juggle things to store more than a dozen GB unless you use a Microsoft card.Disable the fancy visual effects and it's just a very solid experience. Battery life is solid and the built in kickstand works great. Is it/should it be stuck with Windows 10? Yes, basically, but that's fine for the near future. If you have fixed needs this is just wonderfully \"good enough\"\n  \nRead more",

I am running Windows 11 on this sucker doing the exact same workload, and it immediately fixed EVERY SINGLE COMPLAINT I had with the Go 1. The RAM and i3 CPU were what was badly needed!

The Surface Pro 4 was purchased and left in box as a backup until needed. It was stored in a climate controlled office with other similar equipment.  It will only stay on when plugged in. Once you pull the plug, it turns off, so the battery is useless.  It also doesn't boot up normally.  Though I did not find these issues out until after the warranty period, I called Lifecycle Pro to see what we could work out.  I was willing to send back the tablet at my expense to have them fix the battery issue, or I was also willing to send it back and get a store credit on another tablet. Its my fault for not checking the condition of the device when it was received, so I get it. It was in the original box and not opened, so the problems it has now, would've been there upon receipt. I would've offered a customer some level of credit or something...Lifecycle Pro offered nothing.  Considering the 2 tablets I have purchased from them are of little to no value, They made a few hundred, offered subpar tech, and definitely lost our business.\n  \nRead more",

This battery lasts half the time my pro 3 did and is slower than my pro 3.I'm disappointed with it, but it gets the job done. Well, as long as I cool it down and give it a rest when it begins to flicker and am a little patient with it.Honestly, I get more things done and faster on my Samsung phone which replaces most computers (unlike iphones....sorry had to put that in there ;p).Best if you go with Pro 7 or 8 and make monthly payments instead.

I don't like the mobile interface of apple products (despite loving the desktop interface on my iMac). I had a Galaxy Tab 2, which I liked for a while, but I also don't really love the Android interface for a tablet, although I love it for my phone. So, this has been the perfect solution. It's a laptop, but a tablet, but a laptop. It's just frickin' amazing. I also really like Windows 10. I stopped following Windows products when Windows 8 came out, but 10 has been a nice blend of 7 and 8. This really is the best of all worlds!\n  \nRead more",

These refurbs start up fine, appear as near new, have good battery life and function...  If you need a low cost tablet, this is a good option.  Just realize there are no user servicable parts outside of the power supply.  You can't change the screen or battery without special tools - not economic as cheaper to just buy another.  Sad but that is the world they have made for us.\n  \nRead more",

                "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Finally, a proper Macbook Air Competitor",
                "review": "Years ago, I had the original Surface Laptop, and I loved it. It remains one of my favorite laptops of all time.So before I purchased the Surface Laptop 7, I actually had a 14\" 2021 Macbook Pro. It was honestly too much laptop for my needs, but the limited port selection on the Macbook Airs ruled them out for me. Of course, my Macbook Pro was better than the Surface Laptop 7 in many ways - the mini-LED screen is just about the best laptop display you can get, full-stop, whereas the Surface's display is good but not great. The speakers on the Macbook were amazing; the Surface's are quite good but can't compete in that regard.However, I don't regret my purchase for one second because the Surface Laptop 7 is really a Macbook Air competitor, and that is where it shines. I compared the Surface and Macbook Air 13\" side by side and came away with the following conclusions:-Screen: I don't do any serious photo editing or graphic design. To me, the Surface screen is slightly better. It gets much brighter than the Air and colors seem more accurate. However, the Air has better black levels. The Surface is a touchscreen, but I never use it as I don't like fingerprints on my screens. However, if you want a touchscreen, the Surface is clearly the better option. The Surface also has a 120hz display, whereas the Air is stuck at 60hz. The difference in smoothness when scrolling or using trackpad gestures is very noticeable. The Surface's screen looks much smoother.-Speakers: I can't tell the difference between the two. The Surface's speakers are really good compared to other laptops in this class. The same is true of the Macbook Air.-Ports: I had hoped that by 2024, USB-A would be all but gone, but alas it is not. It was very annoying to have to carry around dongles to use USB-A devices on my Macbook Pro, and now I don't have to! The Air has only two USB-C ports, so clearly the Surface wins here. The Macbook Pro does have HDMI, which is nice, but I just bought a USB-C to HDMI cable that I carry around with me, so I don't need a dongle for that either.-Keyboard: I like that the Macbook Air has more than 3 levels of brightness control, but I slightly prefer the key feel on the Surface.- Trackpad: somehow, the Surface's trackpad is better. I am thrilled that Microsoft finally brought a haptic trackpad to the Surface lineup. It feels more delicate and the tactility is stronger. Macbook trackpads are still among the best in the business, but there is finally a Windows laptop that is comparable in this regard.-Login: hands down, Windows Hello is better than the fingerprint reader. It's so fast that my Surface often logs me that it feels like the laptop was left unlocked. The fingerprint scanner on Macbooks are very good, but they are not as fast, nor as convenient, as Windows Hello. My Macbook Pro could also unlock with my Apple Watch, but that almost always took longer than unlocking with my finger.-Build Quality: This has always been a strong point for Surface devices, and the Surface Laptop 7 doesn't disappoint. The laptop can be opened easily with one hand, and the fit and finish is flawless. The same is true of the Macbook Air. I can't say whether one is better than the other. The Surface is designed to be easier to service, however, and you can actually replace the SSD, which is very nice. Additionally, the black finish on my Surface is more resistant to showing fingerprints than the dark blue on the Macbook Airs, which is a fingerprint magnet.-Performance: After owning an Apple Silicon laptop, I could never go back to using an x86/x64 processor. I used Windows 11 for ARM on my Macbook for two years virtualized in Paralells, so I knew what I was getting into. All of the applications I need work beautifully on the Surface, and it is so darn fast. Of course, there are more powerful processors out there using traditional x64 architecture, but I have never used a Windows laptop that is just so snappy for every day tasks. Office apps open in 1-2 seconds. Firefox, Chrome, and Edge open in less than a second. Using gestures to swipe through apps is super snappy, and the high refresh rate screen makes transitions look so smooth. This is the kind of performance I came to except from my Apple Silicon Macbook, and it's wonderful to finally see Windows operating just as responsively.Overall, the Surface feels like an upgrade over my Macbook Pro, and I personally am fine with the tradeoffs that come with the thinner, smaller, and lighter Surface over the more powerful Macbook Pro. It is an utterly fantastic laptop that, in my opinion, is currently the best thin-and-light laptop in the world.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "This incredible, beautiful, elegant and productive laptop showcases what Microsoft is truly capable of, and I'm a Linux guy. I bought the big one - 15\" screen, 32 gig RAM, elite CPU. It is a powerhouse of a laptop.Now - there is one con, but as time progresses the problem becomes less and less of a problem and that is the ARM architecture vs standard Intel x86/64. Basically, this laptop uses a newer, different CPU architecture, which means that many applications don't work yet (YET!!). Almost everything I threw at this laptop worked out of the box and worked beautifully. There were some older applications that didn't work (SimCity Deluxe for example). But and this is a huge BUT - as time passes more applications are supported (or emulated effectively) and it becomes less and less an issue.With the 1 CON out of the way, let's talk about how amazing this laptop is:Premium feel (shell and keyboard). As good as or even better than a MacBook. Yes, for real.Speakers sound delightful.The 15\"-inch sounds like a big laptop but fits perfectly in my backpack and it is still light and small. I mean, unless you are a 5'2\" petite tiny person I don't see how this 15\" laptop is too big for someone.It is plenty fast for doing all sorts of productivity like writing papers, excel spreadsheeting, music, internet, YouTube etc. Understand this isn't a fancy Chromebook. Operating System / Applications are exceptionally fast. This laptop WILL make you more productive just by opening it. It makes you want to work it's so nice.Battery life is OUTSTANDING. If you aren't glued to this laptop for hours at a time the battery will last DAYS. Literally days.Touchpad is also legit. No problems with cursor moving around (palm detection) and typing. Just legit good.Even when watching movies it doesn't get hot. Temperature is steady and cool. I love ARM.In closing, get this laptop. It's nice. Really nice. Like honestly, the nicest laptop I've ever owned (I've had the ASUS ROG 2024, two Dell XPS 15's, Razer Blades, etc.,)For my fellow nerds in the crowd:VMWare & Vbox do NOT work. Remember that ARM is a RISC architecture and neither products support ARM (yet). Docker Desktop for Windows DOES work on ARM. Also, WSL 2.0 also works just fine.Also, with the advent of cloud, lightweight servers (I run a small cloud on my home network) we don't need powerhouse laptops anymore if you have supporting infra. When I'm on travel I just VPN into my home network and I have all the resources I need. So keep something light and portable to work from :)\n  \nRead more",

You can still run traditional exes built for x86/x64 and it will emulate the instructions to ARM (very cool) and it runs native ARM executables.I'm not a huge fan of its dedicated weird charging port... and I had to get a stronger usb cable for charging and a stronger battery bank that supported the wattage required for this thing to even recognize it as a charger for whatever reason..

After it was it returned it get locking up on restart. Didn't know if it hardware compatibility problems so I went thru one by one eliminated those which meant wiping PC clean and restarting from USB boot drive and reloading. The I starting eliminating software. Finally found that the problem was restoring Pictures and Music files from backup hard drives. Apparently the ARM takes a long time to actually finish copying the data to the C: drive and I was restarting before it was finished. Even though the dialog box shows that process is complete it is still running in the background and it takes like 30 minutes or more to finish copying everything over.  I checked the properties of the input folders to the output and they were the same but the process was still running in the background.  What's the point of a fast processor is it runs like an old XP PC? I would have returned the PC but my return date was 3/3/2025 and when I got all this figured out I was a day late!\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I really like this Surface Pro 7. It is exactly as advertised with one exception. The battery life is nowhere near what is advertised. On battery saving mode, using only Onenote for taking class notes, it lasts about 4 hours. Fortunately it charges up very quickly though. I can't see any way that I would get a full days use out of a full battery charge in any circumstance. In my case that is not very important because I am always around an outlet but if you need a tablet that will last all day away from a power source you will have a problem. The camera is good enough, not as good as the Apple camera, but I don't really use it as a camera anyway. I use mostly the 365 programs and find that it integrates these programs seamlessly. Onenote comes with the tablet and has been an amazing app for my vet school classes.  It saves my many hours of study time. My only issues are with the instability of Onenote. It closes itself down every few minutes and is very frustrating. I'm sure there is a fix for this but I'm also sure that I won't get it from Microsorft as they have a technical support team that is on par with the customer service team at the cable company. I've contacted them 3 times now and my issue is never addressed. I was actually told to contact Amazon since they sold it to me. It seems like after spending a thousand dollars on Microsoft products they would at least provide a bit of tech support.  I'll just have to scour the web for a fix to this I guess. Overall I would recommend this tablet to every student. It seems to be a fantastic and fast machine.\n  \nRead more",

                "title": "1.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Don’t buy the surface pro 7 from amazon",
                "review": "Well where do i start..... i ended up getting my item and everything was good for about 20mins of use... however after 20mins my screen would freeze for 10-30 secs. I blew it off at first but then it happen 10mins after then it became a often issue. So i ended up going for an exchange. (The worst idea I’ve ever had). I called up amazon and told them my issue and they were quick to get me a replacement so as first i was satisfied until the surface pro 7 came in the next day. I open the box to find out the box it comes in is not only damage but in a renewed box didn’t even come in the same box it should have come in, then i open that to see the surface pro and the screen film wrapped around it was really dirty as if they dropped it in dirt or so and fingerprints all over the machine. So at this point I’m just hoping it works. This one was not charged at all at 15% like it usually is if you were to buy from Microsoft or an apple device would normally be. So i put it on the charger to find out that it not only has screen tear straight down the middle of the screen but a big red dot half the size of the screen was on there as if they drop the surface pro. So at this point i immediately call amazon and i talked to a representative that ended up giving me a hard time about another replacement even though this one was obviously there fault. So i ended up talking to a supervisor that ended up giving me a hard time as well and in the she said to me that they only do a exchange once but as a one time exception they’ll do the exchange to which i responded with i only want to do the exchange if it’s a brand new product that they are giving me not a renewed one and undamaged. To which she agreed that she would make sure it would be done and put in her notes so the wear house  knows. Well the next day came and guess what.... the man that drops it off throws my package at the wall of my house from a big distance he didn’t see me at all so when i raced over the man jumped in his car and quickly drove away knowing what he did. Not only this but when i open the box the surface pro again was in a dirty renewed box, at this point I’m just hoping it still even worked again no power so i plug it in and guess what it works surprisingly after all that. However i Notice something was different with the boot up process so i knew something was wrong i go to the setting of the computer and the version i bought was 8gb of ram i5 model with 128gb of memory the one i receive as a replacement this time was a 4gb version i5 model with 128gb of memory and GUESS WHAT A DIFFERENT GRAPHICS CARD AS WELL. The surface pro 7 i got not only had 4gb of ram which was wrong but a different graphics card as well that comes in a surface pro 5 are you serious.... so i called up customer service again asking for a supervisor yet again..... just wanting a refund the man told me well i see here that you have a couple of exchange for this device already so i told him this story i am telling now and ask him i wonder why i have “a couple of exchanges” to which he said well instead of a refund i can get you a brand new one and told me how he had to make a couple of phone calls to do this for me so i told him this is the last exchange I’ll be getting ill be asking for a refund next like i previously wanted..if the next one comes in the renewed box which that would mean it’s used.. if it’s broken or the wrong model I’m done with trying and I’m done with the surface pro 7. not only was this the worst experience with amazon that I’ve ever had and worst costumer Service but now I’m going to hate the surface pro 7 because of this. I’ll see what i receive next as of 02/23/2020Sorry for the long review but i felt my experience should be shared for others to see.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "My previous laptop was a godzilla, 15 inch monitor, weighs like 3 pounds or something (2014 model). I was looking for something that had the horsepower for what I needed, but also the lightness to carry it around. Although battery life isnt, the best, I DON'T MIND!This thing is a beast! Im very happy running programs like tableau, zoom, excel, powerpoint, all at the same time and with various files and this thing doesn't even flinch. The first few hours setting up and downloading all the programs it felt a big sluggish and I was starting to get worried. Once that was done, it started to fly.Yes, the rotating screen isnt as flawless as apple's iPad. That said, I bought this not to look pretty, i bought it to be my tool in battle. Being able to run all the programs that a regular PC can run is the main decision I went for Microsoft Surface.  The only downside is that Microsoft is a bit costly on the accessories front.I recommend this piece of tech to anyone who needs to travel or is on the move.  I'm a relatively big guy and i've had no major problem with the size of the keyboard. I do put it FLAT on tables because my keystrokes tend to be pretty hard and the keyboard is the most (in my opinion) fragile of the accessories.Lastly, the Pen interface is not perfect YET but oh man, as a first timer working with it, it kicks total ass and makes note taking in OneNote a complete positive trip.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I am a student-teacher. As such I have to take notes, as well as make lessons for students. This device is fantastic for note-taking and creating documents for schools. The screen is beautiful, and while I wish the bezels were as slim as they were on the surface pro x, I think the bezels are still fine and you tend not to notice them when you're using the device. With a resolution of 2736x1824 (yes, it's a weird resolution) on a 12.3 screen, everything is tack sharp and it has good colour accuracy. I do have a screen calibration tool and did notice quite the difference after calibrating it, but most people will be fine with the base settings.I wouldn't recommend getting the base model (i3 and 4GB ram) since let's be honest, a 4GB ram shouldn't even exist at this point. I think the i5 is the sweet spot, since the i7 isn't really that much better, along with whatever storage option you think you'd need. I'm okay with 256GB. Also, note it does have expandable storage via a micro SD card up to 1TB. The performance on this device is also great about 95% of the time. I get a few weird issues and stutters from time to time, but that is most likely due to windows being windows.The weakest point of this device would definitely be the battery life. While there are worse options out there, I do wish that the battery was slightly better. Having a lot of virtual meetings given the pandemic requires a lot of webcam use and multitasking, and I find that after a couple of hours the battery is already around 30% - with battery-saving mode enabled. When you're not doing that, and you're doing just standard web-browsing and media consumption, you'll be looking at a solid 5-6 hours minimum at acceptable brightness levels.Another negative is that while yes, this device is great, but if you want the full experience, you still have to purchase the type cover, which is another $150+ and the surface pen, which is another $100. So keep in mind that whatever option you choose, you're going to be spending another $300 after taxes.Overall though, writing notes on this device is fantastic, especially if you already use Microsoft 365. I think you can get by with the battery life, and you won't be disappointed by the performance unless you are a heavy user.\n  \nRead more",

La bateria rinde bien y la carga con USB - C le da una ventaja brutal (evidentemente no con un cargador de celular, si no con el de una mac o con el nintendo switch, carga bastante bien).

Was shipped to me unable to charge… I am going to do some of my own trouble shooting and if it goes smoothly I’ll report back with a better rating. I really want this to work out. It just seems like charging is such a basic function  I don’t know how the hell it was the thing that was missed by these “experts”.Edit: Best Buy are the real hero’s here. Was able to get the problem diagnosed. Amazon wouldn’t even send me a replacement charger, even tho it was established the initial one was faulty. So much for a warranty.Over all good price- but you might spend a little more time and money covering for amazons “experts”\n  \nRead more",

I will be purchasing another one very shortly.  The unit was described as being in excellent condition and other than it not being in the original box, I cannot tell it from brand new.  I would definitely not hesitate especially with the savings over a brand-new unit.  I do not game but use primarily for keeping finances, spreadsheets, family tree etc.\n  \nRead more",

But after I got it all set up and updated, I realized the WiFi password didn't take because the keyboard had sticky keys and the password was hidden.  I sent it back the same day I got it.

I am told many other vendors would hesitate to ship a battery in this condition, and it would be good practice to disclose more information to prospective buyers.Buyers may wish to generate their own battery report for refurbished laptops purchasing using command: powercfg /battery report.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Just got my Surface Laptop 3 and I'm happy to report when I took it out of the box and inspected it, it looked like a brand new machine.  I was concerned when I ordered it based on the 2 reviews that this listing had, but I guess I lucked out.  The laptop itself is in excellent condition.  The only flaw I could find on the body is a 1mm scratch on one corner that I was able to cover/hide with a black sharpie.  Now you don't even see it.  The screen is absolutely flawless.  The keyboard is flawless.  Sometimes with laptops, over time, the keys get faded or you notice that oily residue on them that doesn't wash off.  This keyboard looks like it's never been used.  The trackpad is perfect.  The only thing I can't speak to is the battery life remaining.  The \"excellent\" condition by this seller states that the battery is supposed to be above 80% life.  I've charged it fully and discharged it 2 times so far and it seems like the battery is fine.  All the ports work fine and I updated it to Windows 11 without issue.  The laptop came with a power adapter and that's all.  It was packed inside an inflatable bubble wrap and was well protected.  Seller shipped via Fed-ex 2 day shipping for free.  All in all, no complaints.  Very happy.  I did notice that the price fluctuates on this model from this seller.  Sometimes it's a little higher or lower than what I paid.  Not sure why.\n  \nRead more",

It's a Surface Pro 6, so it doesn't have the newer USB-C connection - but that's fine for me, as I find USB-A just a little more convenient (bearing in mind that this isn't a primary computer for my family, but a casual tablet).Also, please note the price - I got this for a mite under $500, which makes it exceptional value today (early 2020), blowing the ~$400 Surface Go out of the water.Mine was \"renewed\" from Mastertronics, and everything looked good. The box had some rather large stickerage on it to make it clear it was renewed. Out of the box it wanted to run first-time W10 setup. After that, checking the battery showed that it had been cycled seven times already (good! Not EXCELLENT, but good!).There's not really much else to say that hasn't been covered by countless SP6 reviews. These renewed ones come without the excellent Type Cover or stylus, it's worth noting. It's a lovely, premium-feeling slab of tablet, without being too heavy (I can't even feel it in my backpack when it goes there in place of my ~2.1KG Acer R7-571 laptop). Battery life is good. So... that's it! $500 is such a bargain for a quality little machine like this, and in my case, the \"renewed\" version was completely problem-free.\n  \nRead more",

Also, the processor was not an I5 8400T.  While using windows, the brown spots turned into white spots and it was very annoying and unbearable to look at. We looked up troubleshooting tips to see if it was something that can be reset. It was recommended on Microsoft site to enter into UEFI mode and if the issue appears there, then it points to screen damage. We unfortunately did not take pictures and decided to have it replaced as the listing from Amazon does say it was eligible for a refund or replacement.We tried to setup an exchange but it told us that our product was not eligible for a return and that we had to contact Amazon. We did so and they informed us we had to return it an order another. Well that is not an exchange but a return. So what is the point of advertising that they offer the ability to exchange? We called back and a supervisor was able to setup the exchange. So we shipped back the item, same day, and a few days later, received the second Surface. WellllllCosmetically it was in worse shape then the first. But we were really not that upset about the exterior and it was going in a case anyway. However, we turned it on and was greeted to the exact same type of burn in white/brown spots (this time we took pictures, albeit not AS bad, but still very noticeable. This time we did the same things as the first unit and just went through windows setup and check to see if its working at all which lead to the next big problem with this unit, the touch screen was messed up. This is going to be kind of hard to show in pictures/video but the top part of the screen does not respond to touch inputs. So I used the tool to calibrate the touch and pen inputs and to no luck, it did not fix it. As someone who will be using this as a tablet more then a laptop, this was way more impossible to overlook then the burn in spots. Now that nothing about this product was in Excellent condition as described in the listing, we at least checked to make sure the specs are correct and things are running correctly to find that the CPU in our unit was not as the one described once again. This time the CPU was an i5-8350U.I would completely understand if the first unit we got was messed up and that mistakes happen or that this unit unfortunately got damaged in shipping, however the 2nd unit being messed up in the same exact manner raises a lot of questions and suspicion. I have a very hard time believing that this company is refurbishing these units when the first step after working on the product should be to turn on the unit and make sure everything is working. There is just no way I can imagine how you just glance over these screen and other issues TWICE. We are extremely disappointed and angry about this whole situation. See pictures and video.\n  \nRead more",

The power cord however was broken this time.  Again another quick conversation and they sent out a replacement cord.  Received that within another 2 days.  End the end it was a tiny Hassel but I got the product and everything works well and as it should.  Take a chance.  These guys will take care of you.  It's appears clean. Looks good.

A tip of the hat to Amazon for at least grading each renewed item into one of three categories. I chose to purchase the top category which is \"Excellent Condition,\" and indeed it is. The Surface 6 that I received is like new in every way except the packaging. The packaging is very good, but not the original box. Most importantly, the Surface 6 works perfectly and I cannot find even one small scratch on it. Your mileage may vary, but I think if you stick with \"excellent condition'\" then you'll be well satisfied. If not, you can take advantage of Amazon's generous return policy.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I recently purchased the Microsoft Surface Pro 7 (Renewed) with 256GB storage, i7 processor, and 16GB RAM and had a generally positive experience, though with some caveats.Pros:First, the condition of the device was impressive. As a renewed product, it looked and felt practically new. The 12.3-inch touchscreen is vibrant, responsive, and works well for both productivity and entertainment. The i7 processor and 16GB of RAM ensure smooth performance, even when handling demanding tasks like multitasking and running multiple apps simultaneously. For my daily work needs, the Surface Pro 7 provided solid reliability.The Windows 10 Pro system is easy to navigate, and the portability of the device is perfect for those who need a lightweight but powerful tablet/laptop hybrid. It's excellent for both work and leisure, especially with the sharp display and excellent touch functionality. Additionally, the Wi-Fi connection was stable, and the overall build quality was top-notch.Cons:Unfortunately, I did run into a significant issue with this device. Upon arrival, I noticed that the battery charging did not work. Despite trying several charging cables and outlets, it would not charge beyond a certain point, which was quite frustrating, especially for a device that’s supposed to be fully functional.However, I must commend the return process. The seller made it easy to return the product and issue a full refund, which was a relief. It’s reassuring to know that purchasing a renewed product doesn’t come with a high risk, as the return process was seamless and quick.Overall: While the product itself was in great condition for being refurbished, the battery charging issue was a deal-breaker. Thankfully, the excellent return and refund policy meant that I wasn’t stuck with a faulty device. I’m still interested in purchasing a replacement, but this experience showed me that buying renewed products can come with risks, even if the overall condition seems good.\n  \nRead more",

This Windows installed with no headaches (after a setting tweak in the System BIOS) and let me swap hardware around without complaining.  No complaints about new drivers going in either.  I got the Device Manager clean as a whistle.  You can use this USB stick to restore the system if it ever gets wiped out by malware or ransomware - just keep all your data in the cloud and your are bullet-proof.  After you build the system you can then sell it for money, as long as you include the Windows USB stick and the Key.  If you try to build many machines with the one USB stick and key you will find problems.  All that said - Windows 11 is not the best OS out there - but it's the one everyone expects.  Once you get GeForce Experience and Steam running it's all about the games.\n  \nRead more",

With the SSD, from power on to login screen is 7 seconds! Amazing. Not wild about the PIN instead of a password thing. Still exploring the new features, so I may update my review in the future.

It is a pain and unless you are using it for an application where you have IT support you likely don’t need one.The PC is dying despite the advantages of its form factor and it is all Microsoft’s fault. They got a monopoly then used the power to make the user experience worse with every edition since at least Windows 7 and probably Windows XP remains the high point for Windows.The process of setting it up should be Microsoft’s chance to shine. Make a good first impression by having a product that just works. Instead you are stuck wasting time because you don’t have hardwired internet and have to lug the computer to the router. Then it doesn’t want to let you install without a Microsoft account. Then you buy the kids a game, and of course it remembers your credit card so they can easily order whatever they want without asking for the card. Not even a the dignity of a check box to not remember the card!The only consolation of a painful few hours setting up a computer is that this horrible user experience has driven the PC into collapse. I asked my wife if she wanted one along with my kids and while she had one for years in the bright days of Windows XP, she didn’t really care to get off her phone long enough to use a computer.\n  \nRead more",

                "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    4 Stars vs Surface Pro series, but as the smallest, least expensive Surface, it is 5 Stars",
                "review": "I'm a big fan of both the 12.3\" Surface Pro (note: current screens are a little larger) and of the mini-me Go lineup. I own one of each of the first three editions of the Go (Go 1 w/10.1\"; and the 10.5\" Go 2 and Go 3). The latest Go 4 is sold through business channels only and hasn't shown up on any used websites yet.What I like (and don't like) about all the Go's:* Killer screen resolution and quality, definitely Amazon Prime-worthy. In settings, I increase the normal display from 150% to 175% for easier reading. You will want to stick with 150% if you have sharp vision and want to split the screen into two windows (I treat my Go's like an iPad, one full window at a time, and just switch windows to cut and paste or see another active program.* Infrared and visible light (camera) combine for highly secure facial scan log-ins. Microsoft wisely recommends using a PIN, custom password for this device, or the facial login so peepers (visual surveillance in real time or through security cameras) can't capture your Microsoft account log-in details. I find the system the the Surface uses to be the most trustworthy (imho equal to Apple facial recognitionand far superior to Android)* Front firing stereo speakers with good clarity (out of tiny slits on the left and right upper corners). Much better than Apple iPad's side-firing edge speakers.* Centrally located front and rear cameras, a good location for video calls. However, in my experience, the iPad 9 and 10 have a far superior microprocessor that provides much better video quality without stuttering. This isn't Microsoft's fault, it's Intel for falling so far behind Apple's in-house design custom chips. At least Microsoft got the camera lens locations perfect from day one, compared to Apple's awkward location on the middle of the side edge (until the iPad 10).* Anti-fall recharging - Microsoft uses a magnetically clamping on power connector that won't yank the table to the floor if you trip on the power cable. It also uses POGO conductive \"dots\" which means there is no \"port\" (plug hole) to get mangled over time and leave you unable to charge your tablet.* The single USB C port WILL also charge the tablet; in fact the Apple 18 watt C and Anker 18 or 20 watt C, chargers will easily re-charge the Surface Go even while you use it.* Screen shape is optimized for full-screen windows, with plenty of width for a normal typewriter page, and extra height compared to the wide angle screens on Android tablets and on most Windows and Chrome laptops. It is the same \"aspect ratio\" as it's bigger brothers, the Surface Pro's.* THAT BUILT-IN KICKSTAND. I've been waiting for years for a kickstand on the iPads, which I also love. First, you don't need an accessory case or cover so you can prop up the tablet on a desk or counter; all you need to do is fold out the kickstand. Second, if is VERY stable unlike an iPad screen cover folded to the rear into a little unstable triangle. And, unlike the iPad case covers and screen covers, you have a wide variety of viewing angles - continuously variable, not just a few clickable positions.* The factor keyboard requires no charging. The factory keyboard is illuminated. No \"pairing\" is required because the hinge on the factory keyboard magnetically snaps on to the bottom edge of the tablet and directly connects via the conductive POGO dots on the tablet and spikes on the keyboard.* There are more than 4  accessory keyboards to choose from. I have used Arteck, Inateck, and Omoton and they are all satisfactory - snap on magnetically just like the factory keyboard, but pair using Buetooth. The Omoton is preferred, in addition to being backlighted, it recharges with a C cable, instead of the now-obsolete Micro USB - so one less cable and perhaps one less charger (modern charges are C on both ends, the transition era of A on the charger and C on the cable end are over, although A=>C is how Amazon still ships their Fire tablets).* The clip-on accessory keyboards also cover and protect the screen while in transit.* On this Go TWO only (plus the later two models), the margins around the screen are narrower than on the Go 1, and the screen is .4\" bigger.* The Go's all accept Micro SD cards, and you can go into settings and change the default file locations from the small 64gb internal storage (typically 11gb-25gb available) to the Micro SD card; I use a 256gb Samsung at $18 from Amazon for this purpose (I can only recommend Samsung, Patriot, and Sandisk). I strongly recommend Samsung, just look for A1 or A2 class for better performance, it doesn't run fast then slow down as it heats up, unlike some competitors.* ONLY THE Go 2-Go 4 RUN WINDOWS 11. This is critical since Microsoft is discontinuing security updates for Windows 10 at the end of this year.* Microsoft's current support for Word's online only version is superb; I no longer have to download either the shorter app version or longer full-version.*eMMC vs SSD vs EFS - the Go 1-3 models with 64gb hard drives use eMMC storage, which is a souped up micro SD card system. The Go 1-3 models with 128gb and up hard drives use full laptop and desktop grade SSD's. The Go 4 models, regardless of storage capacity, use UFS, which is  super-souped up micro SD card system. Supposedly, EFS is almost as fast as a low-end SSD but uses less power and takes up less space. According to test reports, the Go 1-3 with SSD's installed had way faster bulk file transfer speeds, and because they can read/write at the same time, better results in other key areas of performance. HOWEVER in typical use scenarios - YouTube, Spotify, writing - there was no subjective difference in performance.* There are some good deals on Amazon Renewed Surface Go 2's. A lot of companies and some schools use Go's instead of iPads, and close them out on regular cycles. It's not time for inexpensive Go 3's yet. In most cases, if you purchase a used Go 2, it will be a business model and will boot into Pro Windows (although you will need to manually update (by clicking a button) to Windows 11).Let's hit some negatives:* 64gb can end up with 11gb or so left for working space, if you go through all the updates after purchase (including updating to Windows 11). While the operating system is set to erase no-longer needed files monthly, I go into Settings=>Sytem=> Storage and click on Temporary Files and manually delete \"Prior Windows Installations\" to get my available storage back up to 25-30gb.* Multiple browsers eat up storage. I use just Edge and DuckDuckGo browsers; Edge is pre-installed, DuckDuckGo is either on the Microsoft Store or web.* I recommend charging separately. If I charge while using it, it develops a hot spot all the way across the top half. Intel really has some catching up to do with Apple and Android/ARM/Chromebooks on ARM in terms of heat and battery life.* Battery life is as little as 4 hours while watching YouTube or streaming services (as much as 7 hours on Google Docs or Microsoft Word online).* There's no such thing as a simple screen cover. It's keyboard cover, or hit the road jack.Recommendations.+ If you find the right size Dockem, a simple but very useful envelope style protetive cover, they work very well. You have to oversize them properly to allow for the keyboard cover. I suggest measuring things but add .5\" to the size Dockem specs show; or get the next size up from iPad Pro 11 size. Of course you can cheap out and use an Amazon shipping bubble envelope instead, which is more low key through TSA and has your name and address on it for I.D.+ It's a touch screen, but even for videos I use the trackpad on the keyboard so I'm not always get finger print smudges.+ If it's only $30-50 more, 128gb is a more relaxed way to go.+ The built-in security software is very good imho; in 20 years I've stuck with it. However go into Security Settings and make sure Device Security is turned on in hardware options, and make sure you have Enhanced Hardware Security active.+ Don't give up if the initial setup and security updates and upgrade to Windows 11 seems to take forever; it does. Just do it on the kitchen counter while you do other stuff and otherwise respond to its occasional pleas for inputs from you. It is NOT as efficient as updating an iPad. But only the first experience is so bad it hurts. Thereafter, pretty painless+ Your reward is the most compatible operating system on the planet. With iPads and even Chromebooks, sometimes I want to pull my hair out with weird webpage glitches. Never with Windows.\n  \nRead more",

It seemed at first to be in excellent condition until I took off my sunglasses, that’s when I noticed the scuff mark in the body and some type of tacky residue on the back. I’ve cleaned off the tacky residue, which was only in a couple spots, but discovered the scuff since I couldn’t clean it off. This was sold as Refurbished Excellent and it clearly isn’t in excellent condition and some money should be credited back.Update: While using this today, it wasn’t hot as it was normal use on Internet, the screen flickered showing scrambled multi color vertical lines for less than a second each time. Obviously, if they had actually checked this item they would’ve definitely known it isn’t excellent condition. I’m obviously returning this item, shipped tomorrow. I attempted to reset to factory but the seller messed up the Windows 11 install and files were missing so I couldn’t reset to factory; I had to download a factory image from Microsoft which restored it to Windows 10. Upon completing the restore it asked for a login for Livonia Public Schools. I contacted the IT department at the school for a generic login and the following is the email I received back…I'm not sure who you bought this from on Amazon, but I would contact them and return the device. We were not paid for these and the recycler did not have our permission to resell these devices.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I had originally purchased an off brand tablet for about 100 dollars less than this one. As you would expect, it was garbage. It was slow, unreliable and just a perfect example of why buying \"Chinese off brand\" products is hit or miss.When I got my Surface (a full 7 days earlier than expected) I was absolutely blow away by the difference 100 dollars made. It arrived looking absolutely brand new. Honestly, the seller probably could have passed it off as new if they chose to.Setup was pretty straightforward, it runs Windows 10 and it's set to the desktop version so if you have a PC or laptop running Win10, there's almost no learning curve.The speakers are great considering the size of the tablet. Crisp clear sounds. I doubt I'll use it much for video but it's nice to know I can. The screen is clear and easy to read. The touch screen function might take a little getting used to as the OS isn't designed around that aspect, but it's not a big deal. Worst case scenario you can easily use a bluetooth mouse/keyboard.I can't comment on the battery life yet, but so far it doesn't seem like it'll be much of an issue.I bought this primarily for use in a course I'm taking so mostly word processing and web searching, and I don't forsee any issues in that regard.All said and done, buying refurbished electronics can be a little daunting at times, but I'm 100 percent happy with this particular purchase as well as the seller.\n  \nRead more",

The only problem is the included AC adapter is bad…luckily i had an adapter from the computer I was replacing. I used the poor Amazons chat customer service to let them know the PC worked but the ac adapter was bad, and all I needed was a replacement ac adapter. They said ok, a day later I get a approved refund request which I never asked for, all I need is the ac adapter for the computer, no reason the seller should have to replace the entire pc. I needed a pc since mine died, otherwise I wouldn’t have ordered it, I don’t want a refund. If the only way to get a replacement adapter through Amazons poor customer service is to replace the entire computer I’ll just go without and leave a bad review. I am happy to update this bad review if seller can resolve the issue that Amazon has actually made worse.\n  \nRead more",

However, I was taking a chance on this for a work trip because I didn’t want to lug my big laptop around.#1 the charger was not cleaned at all and it definitely grossed me out.#2 the charger only works in certain positions, this is not at all “like new” or “excellent condition”#3 the screen has damaged pixels which are decidedly not “excellent” condition or even “like new”The device itself was cleaned. But I would’ve rather paid for a new surface pro. I’m really disappointed and honestly going to be attempting to return. I took numerous videos of my unboxing and first time experience. If I could have uploaded more than 1 video I definitely would have.I’m sure everyone will not have the same experience as I. Just how about don’t lie about your product? Plenty of people would be happy with something like this but at a cheaper price. A damaged screen, unclean charger, and hardware that has to be fixed in a certain position to charge is definitely not “like new”, “excellent”, or even “refurbished”. Cool you wiped the device and threw it in a box. I’m not impressed.\n  \nRead more",

You absolutely want 8 GB of ram and the Core M3 chip to get a half way fluid desktop experience. The 4gb and Pentium gold version functions but it chokes so much even webbrowsing while downloading updates is janky and that makes it hard to use as a \"normal computer\". 128 GB is really also what you need as the 64gb version will have so much space taken up by windows, windows install files and hybernation files you will have to constantly juggle things to store more than a dozen GB unless you use a Microsoft card.Disable the fancy visual effects and it's just a very solid experience. Battery life is solid and the built in kickstand works great. Is it/should it be stuck with Windows 10? Yes, basically, but that's fine for the near future. If you have fixed needs this is just wonderfully \"good enough\"\n  \nRead more",

The Surface Pro 4 was purchased and left in box as a backup until needed. It was stored in a climate controlled office with other similar equipment.  It will only stay on when plugged in. Once you pull the plug, it turns off, so the battery is useless.  It also doesn't boot up normally.  Though I did not find these issues out until after the warranty period, I called Lifecycle Pro to see what we could work out.  I was willing to send back the tablet at my expense to have them fix the battery issue, or I was also willing to send it back and get a store credit on another tablet. Its my fault for not checking the condition of the device when it was received, so I get it. It was in the original box and not opened, so the problems it has now, would've been there upon receipt. I would've offered a customer some level of credit or something...Lifecycle Pro offered nothing.  Considering the 2 tablets I have purchased from them are of little to no value, They made a few hundred, offered subpar tech, and definitely lost our business.\n  \nRead more",

This battery lasts half the time my pro 3 did and is slower than my pro 3.I'm disappointed with it, but it gets the job done. Well, as long as I cool it down and give it a rest when it begins to flicker and am a little patient with it.Honestly, I get more things done and faster on my Samsung phone which replaces most computers (unlike iphones....sorry had to put that in there ;p).Best if you go with Pro 7 or 8 and make monthly payments instead.

I literally ordered one the next day! I had been in the market for a new tablet, and thought maybe I wanted an iPad, but I just couldn't seem to pull the trigger. I don't like the mobile interface of apple products (despite loving the desktop interface on my iMac). I had a Galaxy Tab 2, which I liked for a while, but I also don't really love the Android interface for a tablet, although I love it for my phone. So, this has been the perfect solution. It's a laptop, but a tablet, but a laptop. It's just frickin' amazing. I also really like Windows 10. I stopped following Windows products when Windows 8 came out, but 10 has been a nice blend of 7 and 8. This really is the best of all worlds!\n  \nRead more",

I buy these frequently as replacements because they burn out in hot industrial environments or freeze when a customer tries too often to restart without the password.  These refurbs start up fine, appear as near new, have good battery life and function...  If you need a low cost tablet, this is a good option.

I reached out to Regency Technologies and they replied that there is nothing they could do as their warranty is only good for 90 days.They could have offered repairs at a fair price. They did nothing.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!\n  \nRead more",

The feature that stands out from this device is the ability to replace the 2230 SSD, but not all SSDs of this type are compatible, it is not compatible with the WD Black SN770MM M.2 2230 and others. I cannot make a return since I am outside the USA, in general I am very disappointed to have used my savings in this purchase to use as a school computer, I will never buy refurbished equipment again\n  \nRead more",

I assumed some scratches on the outside of it like the back or whatever, and it has some of those. But that's fine, no big deal. I assumed it might even have some minor chips or scratches in the glass screen around the edges, and there were, but again no big deal. What I was not expecting was multiple dead patches of pixels on the screen. I certainly wouldn't call that \"good\" condition when little scattered parts of the screen don't work. It's condition is \"ok\" at best. So I'm more than a little disappointed. And the charger that was sent with it must have also been refurbished too, but very poorly. When plugged in, it makes an incredibly loud humming sound that can be heard across the room, and that can be felt in your hand if you pick it up. So careful about what your getting, because their definition of \"good\" is just barely passable. Wishing I spent the extra money to just buy a new one.\n  \nRead more",

I recommend an anti-glare (matte finish) screen protector to control fingerprints and give a nice feeling writing surface if you use the pen.Also a big reason to pick a 7+ over just a 7 is this is a later gen processor so big improvements there, also the SSD is easily expandable, I'll be able to take this surface from 126G to 1TB storage for less than $100 makes this an easy choice.If I have any issues in the future I'll update the review, overall super happy purchase.\n  \nRead more",

There was no problem downloading my photoshop but the tablet has a mid-screen invisible line that does not pick up drawings. The midline remains blank and there is a jarring jump from top to bottom of it (and usually to left or right) when you try to draw across the center of the screen, making it pretty much unusable for that purpose. At first I thought it was the screen protector, then the digital pen, but after changing all of those it's obviously the tablet that is is defective. Definitely will never buy refurbished products again.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Just got my Surface Laptop 3 and I'm happy to report when I took it out of the box and inspected it, it looked like a brand new machine.  I was concerned when I ordered it based on the 2 reviews that this listing had, but I guess I lucked out.  The laptop itself is in excellent condition.  The only flaw I could find on the body is a 1mm scratch on one corner that I was able to cover/hide with a black sharpie.  Now you don't even see it.  The screen is absolutely flawless.  The keyboard is flawless.  Sometimes with laptops, over time, the keys get faded or you notice that oily residue on them that doesn't wash off.  This keyboard looks like it's never been used.  The trackpad is perfect.  The only thing I can't speak to is the battery life remaining.  The \"excellent\" condition by this seller states that the battery is supposed to be above 80% life.  I've charged it fully and discharged it 2 times so far and it seems like the battery is fine.  All the ports work fine and I updated it to Windows 11 without issue.  The laptop came with a power adapter and that's all.  It was packed inside an inflatable bubble wrap and was well protected.  Seller shipped via Fed-ex 2 day shipping for free.  All in all, no complaints.  Very happy.  I did notice that the price fluctuates on this model from this seller.  Sometimes it's a little higher or lower than what I paid.  Not sure why.\n  \nRead more",

Besides that everything is as it is in the product description and I am very happy with my purchase.\n  \nRead more",

But I would’ve rather paid for a new surface pro. I’m really disappointed and honestly going to be attempting to return. I took numerous videos of my unboxing and first time experience. If I could have uploaded more than 1 video I definitely would have.I’m sure everyone will not have the same experience as I. Just how about don’t lie about your product? Plenty of people would be happy with something like this but at a cheaper price. A damaged screen, unclean charger, and hardware that has to be fixed in a certain position to charge is definitely not “like new”, “excellent”, or even “refurbished”. Cool you wiped the device and threw it in a box. I’m not impressed.\n  \nRead more",

Wish I'd found one with more than the 8GB RAM it has, although that hasn't been an issue.  On the 7+ the SSD can be upgraded but the battery and RAM are soldered in place. Also got a Brydge keyboard, which has a trackpad.\n  \nRead more",

The feature that stands out from this device is the ability to replace the 2230 SSD, but not all SSDs of this type are compatible, it is not compatible with the WD Black SN770MM M.2 2230 and others. I cannot make a return since I am outside the USA, in general I am very disappointed to have used my savings in this purchase to use as a school computer, I will never buy refurbished equipment again\n  \nRead more",

I assumed some scratches on the outside of it like the back or whatever, and it has some of those. But that's fine, no big deal. I assumed it might even have some minor chips or scratches in the glass screen around the edges, and there were, but again no big deal. What I was not expecting was multiple dead patches of pixels on the screen. I certainly wouldn't call that \"good\" condition when little scattered parts of the screen don't work. It's condition is \"ok\" at best. So I'm more than a little disappointed. And the charger that was sent with it must have also been refurbished too, but very poorly. When plugged in, it makes an incredibly loud humming sound that can be heard across the room, and that can be felt in your hand if you pick it up. So careful about what your getting, because their definition of \"good\" is just barely passable. Wishing I spent the extra money to just buy a new one.\n  \nRead more",

I recommend an anti-glare (matte finish) screen protector to control fingerprints and give a nice feeling writing surface if you use the pen.Also a big reason to pick a 7+ over just a 7 is this is a later gen processor so big improvements there, also the SSD is easily expandable, I'll be able to take this surface from 126G to 1TB storage for less than $100 makes this an easy choice.If I have any issues in the future I'll update the review, overall super happy purchase.\n  \nRead more",

There was no problem downloading my photoshop but the tablet has a mid-screen invisible line that does not pick up drawings. The midline remains blank and there is a jarring jump from top to bottom of it (and usually to left or right) when you try to draw across the center of the screen, making it pretty much unusable for that purpose. At first I thought it was the screen protector, then the digital pen, but after changing all of those it's obviously the tablet that is is defective. Definitely will never buy refurbished products again.\n  \nRead more",

You can still run traditional exes built for x86/x64 and it will emulate the instructions to ARM (very cool) and it runs native ARM executables.I'm not a huge fan of its dedicated weird charging port... and I had to get a stronger usb cable for charging and a stronger battery bank that supported the wattage required for this thing to even recognize it as a charger for whatever reason.. But otherwise good.\n  \nRead more",

After it was it returned it get locking up on restart. Didn't know if it hardware compatibility problems so I went thru one by one eliminated those which meant wiping PC clean and restarting from USB boot drive and reloading. The I starting eliminating software. Finally found that the problem was restoring Pictures and Music files from backup hard drives. Apparently the ARM takes a long time to actually finish copying the data to the C: drive and I was restarting before it was finished. Even though the dialog box shows that process is complete it is still running in the background and it takes like 30 minutes or more to finish copying everything over.  I checked the properties of the input folders to the output and they were the same but the process was still running in the background.  What's the point of a fast processor is it runs like an old XP PC? I would have returned the PC but my return date was 3/3/2025 and when I got all this figured out I was a day late!\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I really like this Surface Pro 7. It is exactly as advertised with one exception. The battery life is nowhere near what is advertised. On battery saving mode, using only Onenote for taking class notes, it lasts about 4 hours. Fortunately it charges up very quickly though. I can't see any way that I would get a full days use out of a full battery charge in any circumstance. In my case that is not very important because I am always around an outlet but if you need a tablet that will last all day away from a power source you will have a problem. The camera is good enough, not as good as the Apple camera, but I don't really use it as a camera anyway. I use mostly the 365 programs and find that it integrates these programs seamlessly. Onenote comes with the tablet and has been an amazing app for my vet school classes.  It saves my many hours of study time. My only issues are with the instability of Onenote. It closes itself down every few minutes and is very frustrating. I'm sure there is a fix for this but I'm also sure that I won't get it from Microsorft as they have a technical support team that is on par with the customer service team at the cable company. I've contacted them 3 times now and my issue is never addressed. I was actually told to contact Amazon since they sold it to me. It seems like after spending a thousand dollars on Microsoft products they would at least provide a bit of tech support.  I'll just have to scour the web for a fix to this I guess. Overall I would recommend this tablet to every student. It seems to be a fantastic and fast machine.\n  \nRead more",

                "title": "1.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Don’t buy the surface pro 7 from amazon",
                "review": "Well where do i start..... i ended up getting my item and everything was good for about 20mins of use... however after 20mins my screen would freeze for 10-30 secs. I blew it off at first but then it happen 10mins after then it became a often issue. So i ended up going for an exchange. (The worst idea I’ve ever had). I called up amazon and told them my issue and they were quick to get me a replacement so as first i was satisfied until the surface pro 7 came in the next day. I open the box to find out the box it comes in is not only damage but in a renewed box didn’t even come in the same box it should have come in, then i open that to see the surface pro and the screen film wrapped around it was really dirty as if they dropped it in dirt or so and fingerprints all over the machine. So at this point I’m just hoping it works. This one was not charged at all at 15% like it usually is if you were to buy from Microsoft or an apple device would normally be. So i put it on the charger to find out that it not only has screen tear straight down the middle of the screen but a big red dot half the size of the screen was on there as if they drop the surface pro. So at this point i immediately call amazon and i talked to a representative that ended up giving me a hard time about another replacement even though this one was obviously there fault. So i ended up talking to a supervisor that ended up giving me a hard time as well and in the she said to me that they only do a exchange once but as a one time exception they’ll do the exchange to which i responded with i only want to do the exchange if it’s a brand new product that they are giving me not a renewed one and undamaged. To which she agreed that she would make sure it would be done and put in her notes so the wear house  knows. Well the next day came and guess what.... the man that drops it off throws my package at the wall of my house from a big distance he didn’t see me at all so when i raced over the man jumped in his car and quickly drove away knowing what he did. Not only this but when i open the box the surface pro again was in a dirty renewed box, at this point I’m just hoping it still even worked again no power so i plug it in and guess what it works surprisingly after all that. However i Notice something was different with the boot up process so i knew something was wrong i go to the setting of the computer and the version i bought was 8gb of ram i5 model with 128gb of memory the one i receive as a replacement this time was a 4gb version i5 model with 128gb of memory and GUESS WHAT A DIFFERENT GRAPHICS CARD AS WELL. The surface pro 7 i got not only had 4gb of ram which was wrong but a different graphics card as well that comes in a surface pro 5 are you serious.... so i called up customer service again asking for a supervisor yet again..... just wanting a refund the man told me well i see here that you have a couple of exchange for this device already so i told him this story i am telling now and ask him i wonder why i have “a couple of exchanges” to which he said well instead of a refund i can get you a brand new one and told me how he had to make a couple of phone calls to do this for me so i told him this is the last exchange I’ll be getting ill be asking for a refund next like i previously wanted..if the next one comes in the renewed box which that would mean it’s used.. if it’s broken or the wrong model I’m done with trying and I’m done with the surface pro 7. not only was this the worst experience with amazon that I’ve ever had and worst costumer Service but now I’m going to hate the surface pro 7 because of this. I’ll see what i receive next as of 02/23/2020Sorry for the long review but i felt my experience should be shared for others to see.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "My previous laptop was a godzilla, 15 inch monitor, weighs like 3 pounds or something (2014 model). I was looking for something that had the horsepower for what I needed, but also the lightness to carry it around. Although battery life isnt, the best, I DON'T MIND!This thing is a beast! Im very happy running programs like tableau, zoom, excel, powerpoint, all at the same time and with various files and this thing doesn't even flinch. The first few hours setting up and downloading all the programs it felt a big sluggish and I was starting to get worried. Once that was done, it started to fly.Yes, the rotating screen isnt as flawless as apple's iPad. That said, I bought this not to look pretty, i bought it to be my tool in battle. Being able to run all the programs that a regular PC can run is the main decision I went for Microsoft Surface.  The only downside is that Microsoft is a bit costly on the accessories front.I recommend this piece of tech to anyone who needs to travel or is on the move.  I'm a relatively big guy and i've had no major problem with the size of the keyboard. I do put it FLAT on tables because my keystrokes tend to be pretty hard and the keyboard is the most (in my opinion) fragile of the accessories.Lastly, the Pen interface is not perfect YET but oh man, as a first timer working with it, it kicks total ass and makes note taking in OneNote a complete positive trip.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I am a student-teacher. As such I have to take notes, as well as make lessons for students. This device is fantastic for note-taking and creating documents for schools. The screen is beautiful, and while I wish the bezels were as slim as they were on the surface pro x, I think the bezels are still fine and you tend not to notice them when you're using the device. With a resolution of 2736x1824 (yes, it's a weird resolution) on a 12.3 screen, everything is tack sharp and it has good colour accuracy. I do have a screen calibration tool and did notice quite the difference after calibrating it, but most people will be fine with the base settings.I wouldn't recommend getting the base model (i3 and 4GB ram) since let's be honest, a 4GB ram shouldn't even exist at this point. I think the i5 is the sweet spot, since the i7 isn't really that much better, along with whatever storage option you think you'd need. I'm okay with 256GB. Also, note it does have expandable storage via a micro SD card up to 1TB. The performance on this device is also great about 95% of the time. I get a few weird issues and stutters from time to time, but that is most likely due to windows being windows.The weakest point of this device would definitely be the battery life. While there are worse options out there, I do wish that the battery was slightly better. Having a lot of virtual meetings given the pandemic requires a lot of webcam use and multitasking, and I find that after a couple of hours the battery is already around 30% - with battery-saving mode enabled. When you're not doing that, and you're doing just standard web-browsing and media consumption, you'll be looking at a solid 5-6 hours minimum at acceptable brightness levels.Another negative is that while yes, this device is great, but if you want the full experience, you still have to purchase the type cover, which is another $150+ and the surface pen, which is another $100. So keep in mind that whatever option you choose, you're going to be spending another $300 after taxes.Overall though, writing notes on this device is fantastic, especially if you already use Microsoft 365. I think you can get by with the battery life, and you won't be disappointed by the performance unless you are a heavy user.\n  \nRead more",

I need this tablet for school, and I couldn't possibly use this in class as it would be a huge noise distraction. I adjusted the battery to recommended setting, updated, and restarted all like 3 times. Nothing worked. It's going back to this shady company, and I will not purchase anything from them again. They clearly cannot QA/QC...or they just don't care. Huge waste of my time.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I recently purchased the Microsoft Surface Pro 7 (Renewed) with 256GB storage, i7 processor, and 16GB RAM and had a generally positive experience, though with some caveats.Pros:First, the condition of the device was impressive. As a renewed product, it looked and felt practically new. The 12.3-inch touchscreen is vibrant, responsive, and works well for both productivity and entertainment. The i7 processor and 16GB of RAM ensure smooth performance, even when handling demanding tasks like multitasking and running multiple apps simultaneously. For my daily work needs, the Surface Pro 7 provided solid reliability.The Windows 10 Pro system is easy to navigate, and the portability of the device is perfect for those who need a lightweight but powerful tablet/laptop hybrid. It's excellent for both work and leisure, especially with the sharp display and excellent touch functionality. Additionally, the Wi-Fi connection was stable, and the overall build quality was top-notch.Cons:Unfortunately, I did run into a significant issue with this device. Upon arrival, I noticed that the battery charging did not work. Despite trying several charging cables and outlets, it would not charge beyond a certain point, which was quite frustrating, especially for a device that’s supposed to be fully functional.However, I must commend the return process. The seller made it easy to return the product and issue a full refund, which was a relief. It’s reassuring to know that purchasing a renewed product doesn’t come with a high risk, as the return process was seamless and quick.Overall: While the product itself was in great condition for being refurbished, the battery charging issue was a deal-breaker. Thankfully, the excellent return and refund policy meant that I wasn’t stuck with a faulty device. I’m still interested in purchasing a replacement, but this experience showed me that buying renewed products can come with risks, even if the overall condition seems good.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Just got my Surface Laptop 3 and I'm happy to report when I took it out of the box and inspected it, it looked like a brand new machine.  I was concerned when I ordered it based on the 2 reviews that this listing had, but I guess I lucked out.  The laptop itself is in excellent condition.  The only flaw I could find on the body is a 1mm scratch on one corner that I was able to cover/hide with a black sharpie.  Now you don't even see it.  The screen is absolutely flawless.  The keyboard is flawless.  Sometimes with laptops, over time, the keys get faded or you notice that oily residue on them that doesn't wash off.  This keyboard looks like it's never been used.  The trackpad is perfect.  The only thing I can't speak to is the battery life remaining.  The \"excellent\" condition by this seller states that the battery is supposed to be above 80% life.  I've charged it fully and discharged it 2 times so far and it seems like the battery is fine.  All the ports work fine and I updated it to Windows 11 without issue.  The laptop came with a power adapter and that's all.  It was packed inside an inflatable bubble wrap and was well protected.  Seller shipped via Fed-ex 2 day shipping for free.  All in all, no complaints.  Very happy.  I did notice that the price fluctuates on this model from this seller.  Sometimes it's a little higher or lower than what I paid.  Not sure why.\n  \nRead more",

                "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Finally, a proper Macbook Air Competitor",
                "review": "Years ago, I had the original Surface Laptop, and I loved it. It remains one of my favorite laptops of all time.So before I purchased the Surface Laptop 7, I actually had a 14\" 2021 Macbook Pro. It was honestly too much laptop for my needs, but the limited port selection on the Macbook Airs ruled them out for me. Of course, my Macbook Pro was better than the Surface Laptop 7 in many ways - the mini-LED screen is just about the best laptop display you can get, full-stop, whereas the Surface's display is good but not great. The speakers on the Macbook were amazing; the Surface's are quite good but can't compete in that regard.However, I don't regret my purchase for one second because the Surface Laptop 7 is really a Macbook Air competitor, and that is where it shines. I compared the Surface and Macbook Air 13\" side by side and came away with the following conclusions:-Screen: I don't do any serious photo editing or graphic design. To me, the Surface screen is slightly better. It gets much brighter than the Air and colors seem more accurate. However, the Air has better black levels. The Surface is a touchscreen, but I never use it as I don't like fingerprints on my screens. However, if you want a touchscreen, the Surface is clearly the better option. The Surface also has a 120hz display, whereas the Air is stuck at 60hz. The difference in smoothness when scrolling or using trackpad gestures is very noticeable. The Surface's screen looks much smoother.-Speakers: I can't tell the difference between the two. The Surface's speakers are really good compared to other laptops in this class. The same is true of the Macbook Air.-Ports: I had hoped that by 2024, USB-A would be all but gone, but alas it is not. It was very annoying to have to carry around dongles to use USB-A devices on my Macbook Pro, and now I don't have to! The Air has only two USB-C ports, so clearly the Surface wins here. The Macbook Pro does have HDMI, which is nice, but I just bought a USB-C to HDMI cable that I carry around with me, so I don't need a dongle for that either.-Keyboard: I like that the Macbook Air has more than 3 levels of brightness control, but I slightly prefer the key feel on the Surface.- Trackpad: somehow, the Surface's trackpad is better. I am thrilled that Microsoft finally brought a haptic trackpad to the Surface lineup. It feels more delicate and the tactility is stronger. Macbook trackpads are still among the best in the business, but there is finally a Windows laptop that is comparable in this regard.-Login: hands down, Windows Hello is better than the fingerprint reader. It's so fast that my Surface often logs me that it feels like the laptop was left unlocked. The fingerprint scanner on Macbooks are very good, but they are not as fast, nor as convenient, as Windows Hello. My Macbook Pro could also unlock with my Apple Watch, but that almost always took longer than unlocking with my finger.-Build Quality: This has always been a strong point for Surface devices, and the Surface Laptop 7 doesn't disappoint. The laptop can be opened easily with one hand, and the fit and finish is flawless. The same is true of the Macbook Air. I can't say whether one is better than the other. The Surface is designed to be easier to service, however, and you can actually replace the SSD, which is very nice. Additionally, the black finish on my Surface is more resistant to showing fingerprints than the dark blue on the Macbook Airs, which is a fingerprint magnet.-Performance: After owning an Apple Silicon laptop, I could never go back to using an x86/x64 processor. I used Windows 11 for ARM on my Macbook for two years virtualized in Paralells, so I knew what I was getting into. All of the applications I need work beautifully on the Surface, and it is so darn fast. Of course, there are more powerful processors out there using traditional x64 architecture, but I have never used a Windows laptop that is just so snappy for every day tasks. Office apps open in 1-2 seconds. Firefox, Chrome, and Edge open in less than a second. Using gestures to swipe through apps is super snappy, and the high refresh rate screen makes transitions look so smooth. This is the kind of performance I came to except from my Apple Silicon Macbook, and it's wonderful to finally see Windows operating just as responsively.Overall, the Surface feels like an upgrade over my Macbook Pro, and I personally am fine with the tradeoffs that come with the thinner, smaller, and lighter Surface over the more powerful Macbook Pro. It is an utterly fantastic laptop that, in my opinion, is currently the best thin-and-light laptop in the world.\n  \nRead more",

                "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Elegant Computing Defined",
                "review": "This incredible, beautiful, elegant and productive laptop showcases what Microsoft is truly capable of, and I'm a Linux guy. I bought the big one - 15\" screen, 32 gig RAM, elite CPU. It is a powerhouse of a laptop.Now - there is one con, but as time progresses the problem becomes less and less of a problem and that is the ARM architecture vs standard Intel x86/64. Basically, this laptop uses a newer, different CPU architecture, which means that many applications don't work yet (YET!!). Almost everything I threw at this laptop worked out of the box and worked beautifully. There were some older applications that didn't work (SimCity Deluxe for example). But and this is a huge BUT - as time passes more applications are supported (or emulated effectively) and it becomes less and less an issue.With the 1 CON out of the way, let's talk about how amazing this laptop is:Premium feel (shell and keyboard). As good as or even better than a MacBook. Yes, for real.Speakers sound delightful.The 15\"-inch sounds like a big laptop but fits perfectly in my backpack and it is still light and small. I mean, unless you are a 5'2\" petite tiny person I don't see how this 15\" laptop is too big for someone.It is plenty fast for doing all sorts of productivity like writing papers, excel spreadsheeting, music, internet, YouTube etc. Understand this isn't a fancy Chromebook. Operating System / Applications are exceptionally fast. This laptop WILL make you more productive just by opening it. It makes you want to work it's so nice.Battery life is OUTSTANDING. If you aren't glued to this laptop for hours at a time the battery will last DAYS. Literally days.Touchpad is also legit. No problems with cursor moving around (palm detection) and typing. Just legit good.Even when watching movies it doesn't get hot. Temperature is steady and cool. I love ARM.In closing, get this laptop. It's nice. Really nice. Like honestly, the nicest laptop I've ever owned (I've had the ASUS ROG 2024, two Dell XPS 15's, Razer Blades, etc.,)For my fellow nerds in the crowd:VMWare & Vbox do NOT work. Remember that ARM is a RISC architecture and neither products support ARM (yet). Docker Desktop for Windows DOES work on ARM. Also, WSL 2.0 also works just fine.Also, with the advent of cloud, lightweight servers (I run a small cloud on my home network) we don't need powerhouse laptops anymore if you have supporting infra. When I'm on travel I just VPN into my home network and I have all the resources I need. So keep something light and portable to work from :)\n  \nRead more",

It's a Surface Pro 6, so it doesn't have the newer USB-C connection - but that's fine for me, as I find USB-A just a little more convenient (bearing in mind that this isn't a primary computer for my family, but a casual tablet).Also, please note the price - I got this for a mite under $500, which makes it exceptional value today (early 2020), blowing the ~$400 Surface Go out of the water.Mine was \"renewed\" from Mastertronics, and everything looked good. The box had some rather large stickerage on it to make it clear it was renewed. Out of the box it wanted to run first-time W10 setup. After that, checking the battery showed that it had been cycled seven times already (good! Not EXCELLENT, but good!).There's not really much else to say that hasn't been covered by countless SP6 reviews. These renewed ones come without the excellent Type Cover or stylus, it's worth noting. It's a lovely, premium-feeling slab of tablet, without being too heavy (I can't even feel it in my backpack when it goes there in place of my ~2.1KG Acer R7-571 laptop). Battery life is good. So... that's it! $500 is such a bargain for a quality little machine like this, and in my case, the \"renewed\" version was completely problem-free.\n  \nRead more",

Also, the processor was not an I5 8400T.  While using windows, the brown spots turned into white spots and it was very annoying and unbearable to look at. We looked up troubleshooting tips to see if it was something that can be reset. It was recommended on Microsoft site to enter into UEFI mode and if the issue appears there, then it points to screen damage. We unfortunately did not take pictures and decided to have it replaced as the listing from Amazon does say it was eligible for a refund or replacement.We tried to setup an exchange but it told us that our product was not eligible for a return and that we had to contact Amazon. We did so and they informed us we had to return it an order another. Well that is not an exchange but a return. So what is the point of advertising that they offer the ability to exchange? We called back and a supervisor was able to setup the exchange. So we shipped back the item, same day, and a few days later, received the second Surface. WellllllCosmetically it was in worse shape then the first. But we were really not that upset about the exterior and it was going in a case anyway. However, we turned it on and was greeted to the exact same type of burn in white/brown spots (this time we took pictures, albeit not AS bad, but still very noticeable. This time we did the same things as the first unit and just went through windows setup and check to see if its working at all which lead to the next big problem with this unit, the touch screen was messed up. This is going to be kind of hard to show in pictures/video but the top part of the screen does not respond to touch inputs. So I used the tool to calibrate the touch and pen inputs and to no luck, it did not fix it. As someone who will be using this as a tablet more then a laptop, this was way more impossible to overlook then the burn in spots. Now that nothing about this product was in Excellent condition as described in the listing, we at least checked to make sure the specs are correct and things are running correctly to find that the CPU in our unit was not as the one described once again. This time the CPU was an i5-8350U.I would completely understand if the first unit we got was messed up and that mistakes happen or that this unit unfortunately got damaged in shipping, however the 2nd unit being messed up in the same exact manner raises a lot of questions and suspicion. I have a very hard time believing that this company is refurbishing these units when the first step after working on the product should be to turn on the unit and make sure everything is working. There is just no way I can imagine how you just glance over these screen and other issues TWICE. We are extremely disappointed and angry about this whole situation. See pictures and video.\n  \nRead more",

The Surface 6 that I received is like new in every way except the packaging. The packaging is very good, but not the original box. Most importantly, the Surface 6 works perfectly and I cannot find even one small scratch on it. Your mileage may vary, but I think if you stick with \"excellent condition'\" then you'll be well satisfied. If not, you can take advantage of Amazon's generous return policy.\n  \nRead more",

It just seems like charging is such a basic function  I don’t know how the hell it was the thing that was missed by these “experts”.Edit: Best Buy are the real hero’s here. Was able to get the problem diagnosed. Amazon wouldn’t even send me a replacement charger, even tho it was established the initial one was faulty. So much for a warranty.Over all good price- but you might spend a little more time and money covering for amazons “experts”\n  \nRead more",

I am a fan of the Surface products from Microsoft, having had a couple for work and last the Surface 2 for personal use.  I found this on Amazon and was hesitant to purchase a refurbed unit but after reading the reviews and the promise of a good return policy, I decided to take a chance and could not be more pleased.  I will be purchasing another one very shortly.  The unit was described as being in excellent condition and other than it not being in the original box, I cannot tell it from brand new.  I would definitely not hesitate especially with the savings over a brand-new unit.  I do not game but use primarily for keeping finances, spreadsheets, family tree etc.\n  \nRead more",

And it handles external hard drives and runs like any other Microsoft 11 product.  Upgraded the 128GB to 2TB.  Wish I'd found one with more than the 8GB RAM it has, although that hasn't been an issue.  On the 7+ the SSD can be upgraded but the battery and RAM are soldered in place. Also got a Brydge keyboard, which has a trackpad.\n  \nRead more",

The feature that stands out from this device is the ability to replace the 2230 SSD, but not all SSDs of this type are compatible, it is not compatible with the WD Black SN770MM M.2 2230 and others. I cannot make a return since I am outside the USA, in general I am very disappointed to have used my savings in this purchase to use as a school computer, I will never buy refurbished equipment again\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Overall I really like the computer. It's fast and compact and it starts up quickly. It was refurbished and being sold in ”good\" condition. I assumed some scratches on the outside of it like the back or whatever, and it has some of those. But that's fine, no big deal. I assumed it might even have some minor chips or scratches in the glass screen around the edges, and there were, but again no big deal. What I was not expecting was multiple dead patches of pixels on the screen. I certainly wouldn't call that \"good\" condition when little scattered parts of the screen don't work. It's condition is \"ok\" at best. So I'm more than a little disappointed. And the charger that was sent with it must have also been refurbished too, but very poorly. When plugged in, it makes an incredibly loud humming sound that can be heard across the room, and that can be felt in your hand if you pick it up. So careful about what your getting, because their definition of \"good\" is just barely passable. Wishing I spent the extra money to just buy a new one.\n  \nRead more",

I recommend an anti-glare (matte finish) screen protector to control fingerprints and give a nice feeling writing surface if you use the pen.Also a big reason to pick a 7+ over just a 7 is this is a later gen processor so big improvements there, also the SSD is easily expandable, I'll be able to take this surface from 126G to 1TB storage for less than $100 makes this an easy choice.If I have any issues in the future I'll update the review, overall super happy purchase.\n  \nRead more",

There was no problem downloading my photoshop but the tablet has a mid-screen invisible line that does not pick up drawings. The midline remains blank and there is a jarring jump from top to bottom of it (and usually to left or right) when you try to draw across the center of the screen, making it pretty much unusable for that purpose. At first I thought it was the screen protector, then the digital pen, but after changing all of those it's obviously the tablet that is is defective. Definitely will never buy refurbished products again.\n  \nRead more",

But I would’ve rather paid for a new surface pro. I’m really disappointed and honestly going to be attempting to return. I took numerous videos of my unboxing and first time experience. If I could have uploaded more than 1 video I definitely would have.I’m sure everyone will not have the same experience as I. Just how about don’t lie about your product? Plenty of people would be happy with something like this but at a cheaper price. A damaged screen, unclean charger, and hardware that has to be fixed in a certain position to charge is definitely not “like new”, “excellent”, or even “refurbished”. Cool you wiped the device and threw it in a box. I’m not impressed.\n  \nRead more",

This Windows installed with no headaches (after a setting tweak in the System BIOS) and let me swap hardware around without complaining.  No complaints about new drivers going in either.  I got the Device Manager clean as a whistle.  You can use this USB stick to restore the system if it ever gets wiped out by malware or ransomware - just keep all your data in the cloud and your are bullet-proof.  After you build the system you can then sell it for money, as long as you include the Windows USB stick and the Key.  If you try to build many machines with the one USB stick and key you will find problems.  All that said - Windows 11 is not the best OS out there - but it's the one everyone expects.  Once you get GeForce Experience and Steam running it's all about the games.\n  \nRead more",

Since I am a registered owner of Windows 10, it latched onto my Win10 license and used it as an upgrade. My Win 11 product key is unused, bonus! So far I haven't experienced any issues or errors. With the SSD, from power on to login screen is 7 seconds! Amazing. Not wild about the PIN instead of a password thing. Still exploring the new features, so I may update my review in the future. All in all, happy with the product so far.Update: A month and a half in, still working as advertised. Maybe M$ finally got an OS correct lol\n  \nRead more",

It is a pain and unless you are using it for an application where you have IT support you likely don’t need one.The PC is dying despite the advantages of its form factor and it is all Microsoft’s fault. They got a monopoly then used the power to make the user experience worse with every edition since at least Windows 7 and probably Windows XP remains the high point for Windows.The process of setting it up should be Microsoft’s chance to shine. Make a good first impression by having a product that just works. Instead you are stuck wasting time because you don’t have hardwired internet and have to lug the computer to the router. Then it doesn’t want to let you install without a Microsoft account. Then you buy the kids a game, and of course it remembers your credit card so they can easily order whatever they want without asking for the card. Not even a the dignity of a check box to not remember the card!The only consolation of a painful few hours setting up a computer is that this horrible user experience has driven the PC into collapse. I asked my wife if she wanted one along with my kids and while she had one for years in the bright days of Windows XP, she didn’t really care to get off her phone long enough to use a computer.\n  \nRead more",

You absolutely want 8 GB of ram and the Core M3 chip to get a half way fluid desktop experience. The 4gb and Pentium gold version functions but it chokes so much even webbrowsing while downloading updates is janky and that makes it hard to use as a \"normal computer\". 128 GB is really also what you need as the 64gb version will have so much space taken up by windows, windows install files and hybernation files you will have to constantly juggle things to store more than a dozen GB unless you use a Microsoft card.Disable the fancy visual effects and it's just a very solid experience. Battery life is solid and the built in kickstand works great. Is it/should it be stuck with Windows 10? Yes, basically, but that's fine for the near future. If you have fixed needs this is just wonderfully \"good enough\"\n  \nRead more",

However the low RAM and weak CPU meant it couldn't even keep up with the on-screen keyboard when you were typing. I don't want to mention the other things that went wrong with simple OS operations that should take 30 seconds ending up leaving me stuck for 20 minutes or more. I am running Windows 11 on this sucker doing the exact same workload, and it immediately fixed EVERY SINGLE COMPLAINT I had with the Go 1. The RAM and i3 CPU were what was badly needed! Now it's perfect. This is my robbery computer I carry to coffee shops in Colombia.

The first one arrived with a broken charging cable and NO internal battery. This tablet makes a VERY loud sound coming from the fan, and the battery gets very warm very fast. I need this tablet for school, and I couldn't possibly use this in class as it would be a huge noise distraction. I adjusted the battery to recommended setting, updated, and restarted all like 3 times. Nothing worked. It's going back to this shady company, and I will not purchase anything from them again. They clearly cannot QA/QC...or they just don't care. Huge waste of my time.\n  \nRead more",

It just seems like charging is such a basic function  I don’t know how the hell it was the thing that was missed by these “experts”.Edit: Best Buy are the real hero’s here.

So much for a warranty.Over all good price- but you might spend a little more time and money covering for amazons “experts”\n  \nRead more",

I am a fan of the Surface products from Microsoft, having had a couple for work and last the Surface 2 for personal use.  I found this on Amazon and was hesitant to purchase a refurbed unit but after reading the reviews and the promise of a good return policy, I decided to take a chance and could not be more pleased.  I will be purchasing another one very shortly.  The unit was described as being in excellent condition and other than it not being in the original box, I cannot tell it from brand new.  I would definitely not hesitate especially with the savings over a brand-new unit.  I do not game but use primarily for keeping finances, spreadsheets, family tree etc.\n  \nRead more",

The Surface Pro 4 was purchased and left in box as a backup until needed. It was stored in a climate controlled office with other similar equipment.  It will only stay on when plugged in. Once you pull the plug, it turns off, so the battery is useless.  It also doesn't boot up normally.  Though I did not find these issues out until after the warranty period, I called Lifecycle Pro to see what we could work out.  I was willing to send back the tablet at my expense to have them fix the battery issue, or I was also willing to send it back and get a store credit on another tablet. Its my fault for not checking the condition of the device when it was received, so I get it. It was in the original box and not opened, so the problems it has now, would've been there upon receipt. I would've offered a customer some level of credit or something...Lifecycle Pro offered nothing.  Considering the 2 tablets I have purchased from them are of little to no value, They made a few hundred, offered subpar tech, and definitely lost our business.\n  \nRead more",

This battery lasts half the time my pro 3 did and is slower than my pro 3.I'm disappointed with it, but it gets the job done. Well, as long as I cool it down and give it a rest when it begins to flicker and am a little patient with it.Honestly, I get more things done and faster on my Samsung phone which replaces most computers (unlike iphones....sorry had to put that in there ;p).Best if you go with Pro 7 or 8 and make monthly payments instead.

I literally ordered one the next day! I had been in the market for a new tablet, and thought maybe I wanted an iPad, but I just couldn't seem to pull the trigger. I don't like the mobile interface of apple products (despite loving the desktop interface on my iMac). I had a Galaxy Tab 2, which I liked for a while, but I also don't really love the Android interface for a tablet, although I love it for my phone. So, this has been the perfect solution. It's a laptop, but a tablet, but a laptop. It's just frickin' amazing. I also really like Windows 10. I stopped following Windows products when Windows 8 came out, but 10 has been a nice blend of 7 and 8. This really is the best of all worlds!\n  \nRead more",

I buy these frequently as replacements because they burn out in hot industrial environments or freeze when a customer tries too often to restart without the password.  These refurbs start up fine, appear as near new, have good battery life and function...  If you need a low cost tablet, this is a good option.  Just realize there are no user servicable parts outside of the power supply.  You can't change the screen or battery without special tools - not economic as cheaper to just buy another.

It's a Surface Pro 6, so it doesn't have the newer USB-C connection - but that's fine for me, as I find USB-A just a little more convenient (bearing in mind that this isn't a primary computer for my family, but a casual tablet).Also, please note the price - I got this for a mite under $500, which makes it exceptional value today (early 2020), blowing the ~$400 Surface Go out of the water.Mine was \"renewed\" from Mastertronics, and everything looked good. The box had some rather large stickerage on it to make it clear it was renewed. Out of the box it wanted to run first-time W10 setup. After that, checking the battery showed that it had been cycled seven times already (good! Not EXCELLENT, but good!).There's not really much else to say that hasn't been covered by countless SP6 reviews. These renewed ones come without the excellent Type Cover or stylus, it's worth noting. It's a lovely, premium-feeling slab of tablet, without being too heavy (I can't even feel it in my backpack when it goes there in place of my ~2.1KG Acer R7-571 laptop). Battery life is good. So... that's it! $500 is such a bargain for a quality little machine like this, and in my case, the \"renewed\" version was completely problem-free.\n  \nRead more",

Also, the processor was not an I5 8400T.  While using windows, the brown spots turned into white spots and it was very annoying and unbearable to look at. We looked up troubleshooting tips to see if it was something that can be reset. It was recommended on Microsoft site to enter into UEFI mode and if the issue appears there, then it points to screen damage. We unfortunately did not take pictures and decided to have it replaced as the listing from Amazon does say it was eligible for a refund or replacement.We tried to setup an exchange but it told us that our product was not eligible for a return and that we had to contact Amazon. We did so and they informed us we had to return it an order another. Well that is not an exchange but a return. So what is the point of advertising that they offer the ability to exchange? We called back and a supervisor was able to setup the exchange. So we shipped back the item, same day, and a few days later, received the second Surface. WellllllCosmetically it was in worse shape then the first. But we were really not that upset about the exterior and it was going in a case anyway. However, we turned it on and was greeted to the exact same type of burn in white/brown spots (this time we took pictures, albeit not AS bad, but still very noticeable. This time we did the same things as the first unit and just went through windows setup and check to see if its working at all which lead to the next big problem with this unit, the touch screen was messed up. This is going to be kind of hard to show in pictures/video but the top part of the screen does not respond to touch inputs. So I used the tool to calibrate the touch and pen inputs and to no luck, it did not fix it. As someone who will be using this as a tablet more then a laptop, this was way more impossible to overlook then the burn in spots. Now that nothing about this product was in Excellent condition as described in the listing, we at least checked to make sure the specs are correct and things are running correctly to find that the CPU in our unit was not as the one described once again. This time the CPU was an i5-8350U.I would completely understand if the first unit we got was messed up and that mistakes happen or that this unit unfortunately got damaged in shipping, however the 2nd unit being messed up in the same exact manner raises a lot of questions and suspicion. I have a very hard time believing that this company is refurbishing these units when the first step after working on the product should be to turn on the unit and make sure everything is working. There is just no way I can imagine how you just glance over these screen and other issues TWICE. We are extremely disappointed and angry about this whole situation. See pictures and video.\n  \nRead more",

A tip of the hat to Amazon for at least grading each renewed item into one of three categories. I chose to purchase the top category which is \"Excellent Condition,\" and indeed it is. The Surface 6 that I received is like new in every way except the packaging. The packaging is very good, but not the original box. Most importantly, the Surface 6 works perfectly and I cannot find even one small scratch on it. Your mileage may vary, but I think if you stick with \"excellent condition'\" then you'll be well satisfied. If not, you can take advantage of Amazon's generous return policy.\n  \nRead more",

                "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    4 Stars vs Surface Pro series, but as the smallest, least expensive Surface, it is 5 Stars",
                "review": "I'm a big fan of both the 12.3\" Surface Pro (note: current screens are a little larger) and of the mini-me Go lineup. I own one of each of the first three editions of the Go (Go 1 w/10.1\"; and the 10.5\" Go 2 and Go 3). The latest Go 4 is sold through business channels only and hasn't shown up on any used websites yet.What I like (and don't like) about all the Go's:* Killer screen resolution and quality, definitely Amazon Prime-worthy. In settings, I increase the normal display from 150% to 175% for easier reading. You will want to stick with 150% if you have sharp vision and want to split the screen into two windows (I treat my Go's like an iPad, one full window at a time, and just switch windows to cut and paste or see another active program.* Infrared and visible light (camera) combine for highly secure facial scan log-ins. Microsoft wisely recommends using a PIN, custom password for this device, or the facial login so peepers (visual surveillance in real time or through security cameras) can't capture your Microsoft account log-in details. I find the system the the Surface uses to be the most trustworthy (imho equal to Apple facial recognitionand far superior to Android)* Front firing stereo speakers with good clarity (out of tiny slits on the left and right upper corners). Much better than Apple iPad's side-firing edge speakers.* Centrally located front and rear cameras, a good location for video calls. However, in my experience, the iPad 9 and 10 have a far superior microprocessor that provides much better video quality without stuttering. This isn't Microsoft's fault, it's Intel for falling so far behind Apple's in-house design custom chips. At least Microsoft got the camera lens locations perfect from day one, compared to Apple's awkward location on the middle of the side edge (until the iPad 10).* Anti-fall recharging - Microsoft uses a magnetically clamping on power connector that won't yank the table to the floor if you trip on the power cable. It also uses POGO conductive \"dots\" which means there is no \"port\" (plug hole) to get mangled over time and leave you unable to charge your tablet.* The single USB C port WILL also charge the tablet; in fact the Apple 18 watt C and Anker 18 or 20 watt C, chargers will easily re-charge the Surface Go even while you use it.* Screen shape is optimized for full-screen windows, with plenty of width for a normal typewriter page, and extra height compared to the wide angle screens on Android tablets and on most Windows and Chrome laptops. It is the same \"aspect ratio\" as it's bigger brothers, the Surface Pro's.* THAT BUILT-IN KICKSTAND. I've been waiting for years for a kickstand on the iPads, which I also love. First, you don't need an accessory case or cover so you can prop up the tablet on a desk or counter; all you need to do is fold out the kickstand. Second, if is VERY stable unlike an iPad screen cover folded to the rear into a little unstable triangle. And, unlike the iPad case covers and screen covers, you have a wide variety of viewing angles - continuously variable, not just a few clickable positions.* The factor keyboard requires no charging. The factory keyboard is illuminated. No \"pairing\" is required because the hinge on the factory keyboard magnetically snaps on to the bottom edge of the tablet and directly connects via the conductive POGO dots on the tablet and spikes on the keyboard.* There are more than 4  accessory keyboards to choose from. I have used Arteck, Inateck, and Omoton and they are all satisfactory - snap on magnetically just like the factory keyboard, but pair using Buetooth. The Omoton is preferred, in addition to being backlighted, it recharges with a C cable, instead of the now-obsolete Micro USB - so one less cable and perhaps one less charger (modern charges are C on both ends, the transition era of A on the charger and C on the cable end are over, although A=>C is how Amazon still ships their Fire tablets).* The clip-on accessory keyboards also cover and protect the screen while in transit.* On this Go TWO only (plus the later two models), the margins around the screen are narrower than on the Go 1, and the screen is .4\" bigger.* The Go's all accept Micro SD cards, and you can go into settings and change the default file locations from the small 64gb internal storage (typically 11gb-25gb available) to the Micro SD card; I use a 256gb Samsung at $18 from Amazon for this purpose (I can only recommend Samsung, Patriot, and Sandisk). I strongly recommend Samsung, just look for A1 or A2 class for better performance, it doesn't run fast then slow down as it heats up, unlike some competitors.* ONLY THE Go 2-Go 4 RUN WINDOWS 11. This is critical since Microsoft is discontinuing security updates for Windows 10 at the end of this year.* Microsoft's current support for Word's online only version is superb; I no longer have to download either the shorter app version or longer full-version.*eMMC vs SSD vs EFS - the Go 1-3 models with 64gb hard drives use eMMC storage, which is a souped up micro SD card system. The Go 1-3 models with 128gb and up hard drives use full laptop and desktop grade SSD's. The Go 4 models, regardless of storage capacity, use UFS, which is  super-souped up micro SD card system. Supposedly, EFS is almost as fast as a low-end SSD but uses less power and takes up less space. According to test reports, the Go 1-3 with SSD's installed had way faster bulk file transfer speeds, and because they can read/write at the same time, better results in other key areas of performance. HOWEVER in typical use scenarios - YouTube, Spotify, writing - there was no subjective difference in performance.* There are some good deals on Amazon Renewed Surface Go 2's. A lot of companies and some schools use Go's instead of iPads, and close them out on regular cycles. It's not time for inexpensive Go 3's yet. In most cases, if you purchase a used Go 2, it will be a business model and will boot into Pro Windows (although you will need to manually update (by clicking a button) to Windows 11).Let's hit some negatives:* 64gb can end up with 11gb or so left for working space, if you go through all the updates after purchase (including updating to Windows 11). While the operating system is set to erase no-longer needed files monthly, I go into Settings=>Sytem=> Storage and click on Temporary Files and manually delete \"Prior Windows Installations\" to get my available storage back up to 25-30gb.* Multiple browsers eat up storage. I use just Edge and DuckDuckGo browsers; Edge is pre-installed, DuckDuckGo is either on the Microsoft Store or web.* I recommend charging separately. If I charge while using it, it develops a hot spot all the way across the top half. Intel really has some catching up to do with Apple and Android/ARM/Chromebooks on ARM in terms of heat and battery life.* Battery life is as little as 4 hours while watching YouTube or streaming services (as much as 7 hours on Google Docs or Microsoft Word online).* There's no such thing as a simple screen cover. It's keyboard cover, or hit the road jack.Recommendations.+ If you find the right size Dockem, a simple but very useful envelope style protetive cover, they work very well. You have to oversize them properly to allow for the keyboard cover. I suggest measuring things but add .5\" to the size Dockem specs show; or get the next size up from iPad Pro 11 size. Of course you can cheap out and use an Amazon shipping bubble envelope instead, which is more low key through TSA and has your name and address on it for I.D.+ It's a touch screen, but even for videos I use the trackpad on the keyboard so I'm not always get finger print smudges.+ If it's only $30-50 more, 128gb is a more relaxed way to go.+ The built-in security software is very good imho; in 20 years I've stuck with it. However go into Security Settings and make sure Device Security is turned on in hardware options, and make sure you have Enhanced Hardware Security active.+ Don't give up if the initial setup and security updates and upgrade to Windows 11 seems to take forever; it does. Just do it on the kitchen counter while you do other stuff and otherwise respond to its occasional pleas for inputs from you. It is NOT as efficient as updating an iPad. But only the first experience is so bad it hurts. Thereafter, pretty painless+ Your reward is the most compatible operating system on the planet. With iPads and even Chromebooks, sometimes I want to pull my hair out with weird webpage glitches. Never with Windows.\n  \nRead more",

I sooke to cs and they sent me a replacement that also does not charge via c port charger. You need an outlet or AC plug battery pack if you want to charge this when you are on the road. I returned the replacemnt and kept my original order.The battery on this product lasted me more than 8 hours on a full charge with constant use. Which was good.I liked the size and the functionality.I biught a keyboard as my clients sometimes uses the keyboard during signing . I am a mobile notary.\n  \nRead more",

It seemed at first to be in excellent condition until I took off my sunglasses, that’s when I noticed the scuff mark in the body and some type of tacky residue on the back. I’ve cleaned off the tacky residue, which was only in a couple spots, but discovered the scuff since I couldn’t clean it off. This was sold as Refurbished Excellent and it clearly isn’t in excellent condition and some money should be credited back.Update: While using this today, it wasn’t hot as it was normal use on Internet, the screen flickered showing scrambled multi color vertical lines for less than a second each time. Obviously, if they had actually checked this item they would’ve definitely known it isn’t excellent condition. I’m obviously returning this item, shipped tomorrow. I attempted to reset to factory but the seller messed up the Windows 11 install and files were missing so I couldn’t reset to factory; I had to download a factory image from Microsoft which restored it to Windows 10. Upon completing the restore it asked for a login for Livonia Public Schools. I contacted the IT department at the school for a generic login and the following is the email I received back…I'm not sure who you bought this from on Amazon, but I would contact them and return the device. We were not paid for these and the recycler did not have our permission to resell these devices.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I had originally purchased an off brand tablet for about 100 dollars less than this one. As you would expect, it was garbage. It was slow, unreliable and just a perfect example of why buying \"Chinese off brand\" products is hit or miss.When I got my Surface (a full 7 days earlier than expected) I was absolutely blow away by the difference 100 dollars made. It arrived looking absolutely brand new. Honestly, the seller probably could have passed it off as new if they chose to.Setup was pretty straightforward, it runs Windows 10 and it's set to the desktop version so if you have a PC or laptop running Win10, there's almost no learning curve.The speakers are great considering the size of the tablet. Crisp clear sounds. I doubt I'll use it much for video but it's nice to know I can. The screen is clear and easy to read. The touch screen function might take a little getting used to as the OS isn't designed around that aspect, but it's not a big deal. Worst case scenario you can easily use a bluetooth mouse/keyboard.I can't comment on the battery life yet, but so far it doesn't seem like it'll be much of an issue.I bought this primarily for use in a course I'm taking so mostly word processing and web searching, and I don't forsee any issues in that regard.All said and done, buying refurbished electronics can be a little daunting at times, but I'm 100 percent happy with this particular purchase as well as the seller.\n  \nRead more",
