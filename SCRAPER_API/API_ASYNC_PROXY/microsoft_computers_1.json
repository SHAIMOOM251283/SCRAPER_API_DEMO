                "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Finally, a proper Macbook Air Competitor",
                "review": "Years ago, I had the original Surface Laptop, and I loved it. It remains one of my favorite laptops of all time.So before I purchased the Surface Laptop 7, I actually had a 14\" 2021 Macbook Pro. It was honestly too much laptop for my needs, but the limited port selection on the Macbook Airs ruled them out for me. Of course, my Macbook Pro was better than the Surface Laptop 7 in many ways - the mini-LED screen is just about the best laptop display you can get, full-stop, whereas the Surface's display is good but not great. The speakers on the Macbook were amazing; the Surface's are quite good but can't compete in that regard.However, I don't regret my purchase for one second because the Surface Laptop 7 is really a Macbook Air competitor, and that is where it shines. I compared the Surface and Macbook Air 13\" side by side and came away with the following conclusions:-Screen: I don't do any serious photo editing or graphic design. To me, the Surface screen is slightly better. It gets much brighter than the Air and colors seem more accurate. However, the Air has better black levels. The Surface is a touchscreen, but I never use it as I don't like fingerprints on my screens. However, if you want a touchscreen, the Surface is clearly the better option. The Surface also has a 120hz display, whereas the Air is stuck at 60hz. The difference in smoothness when scrolling or using trackpad gestures is very noticeable. The Surface's screen looks much smoother.-Speakers: I can't tell the difference between the two. The Surface's speakers are really good compared to other laptops in this class. The same is true of the Macbook Air.-Ports: I had hoped that by 2024, USB-A would be all but gone, but alas it is not. It was very annoying to have to carry around dongles to use USB-A devices on my Macbook Pro, and now I don't have to! The Air has only two USB-C ports, so clearly the Surface wins here. The Macbook Pro does have HDMI, which is nice, but I just bought a USB-C to HDMI cable that I carry around with me, so I don't need a dongle for that either.-Keyboard: I like that the Macbook Air has more than 3 levels of brightness control, but I slightly prefer the key feel on the Surface.- Trackpad: somehow, the Surface's trackpad is better. I am thrilled that Microsoft finally brought a haptic trackpad to the Surface lineup. It feels more delicate and the tactility is stronger. Macbook trackpads are still among the best in the business, but there is finally a Windows laptop that is comparable in this regard.-Login: hands down, Windows Hello is better than the fingerprint reader. It's so fast that my Surface often logs me that it feels like the laptop was left unlocked. The fingerprint scanner on Macbooks are very good, but they are not as fast, nor as convenient, as Windows Hello. My Macbook Pro could also unlock with my Apple Watch, but that almost always took longer than unlocking with my finger.-Build Quality: This has always been a strong point for Surface devices, and the Surface Laptop 7 doesn't disappoint. The laptop can be opened easily with one hand, and the fit and finish is flawless. The same is true of the Macbook Air. I can't say whether one is better than the other. The Surface is designed to be easier to service, however, and you can actually replace the SSD, which is very nice. Additionally, the black finish on my Surface is more resistant to showing fingerprints than the dark blue on the Macbook Airs, which is a fingerprint magnet.-Performance: After owning an Apple Silicon laptop, I could never go back to using an x86/x64 processor. I used Windows 11 for ARM on my Macbook for two years virtualized in Paralells, so I knew what I was getting into. All of the applications I need work beautifully on the Surface, and it is so darn fast. Of course, there are more powerful processors out there using traditional x64 architecture, but I have never used a Windows laptop that is just so snappy for every day tasks. Office apps open in 1-2 seconds. Firefox, Chrome, and Edge open in less than a second. Using gestures to swipe through apps is super snappy, and the high refresh rate screen makes transitions look so smooth. This is the kind of performance I came to except from my Apple Silicon Macbook, and it's wonderful to finally see Windows operating just as responsively.Overall, the Surface feels like an upgrade over my Macbook Pro, and I personally am fine with the tradeoffs that come with the thinner, smaller, and lighter Surface over the more powerful Macbook Pro. It is an utterly fantastic laptop that, in my opinion, is currently the best thin-and-light laptop in the world.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "This incredible, beautiful, elegant and productive laptop showcases what Microsoft is truly capable of, and I'm a Linux guy. I bought the big one - 15\" screen, 32 gig RAM, elite CPU. It is a powerhouse of a laptop.Now - there is one con, but as time progresses the problem becomes less and less of a problem and that is the ARM architecture vs standard Intel x86/64. Basically, this laptop uses a newer, different CPU architecture, which means that many applications don't work yet (YET!!). Almost everything I threw at this laptop worked out of the box and worked beautifully. There were some older applications that didn't work (SimCity Deluxe for example). But and this is a huge BUT - as time passes more applications are supported (or emulated effectively) and it becomes less and less an issue.With the 1 CON out of the way, let's talk about how amazing this laptop is:Premium feel (shell and keyboard). As good as or even better than a MacBook. Yes, for real.Speakers sound delightful.The 15\"-inch sounds like a big laptop but fits perfectly in my backpack and it is still light and small. I mean, unless you are a 5'2\" petite tiny person I don't see how this 15\" laptop is too big for someone.It is plenty fast for doing all sorts of productivity like writing papers, excel spreadsheeting, music, internet, YouTube etc. Understand this isn't a fancy Chromebook. Operating System / Applications are exceptionally fast. This laptop WILL make you more productive just by opening it. It makes you want to work it's so nice.Battery life is OUTSTANDING. If you aren't glued to this laptop for hours at a time the battery will last DAYS. Literally days.Touchpad is also legit. No problems with cursor moving around (palm detection) and typing. Just legit good.Even when watching movies it doesn't get hot. Temperature is steady and cool. I love ARM.In closing, get this laptop. It's nice. Really nice. Like honestly, the nicest laptop I've ever owned (I've had the ASUS ROG 2024, two Dell XPS 15's, Razer Blades, etc.,)For my fellow nerds in the crowd:VMWare & Vbox do NOT work. Remember that ARM is a RISC architecture and neither products support ARM (yet). Docker Desktop for Windows DOES work on ARM. Also, WSL 2.0 also works just fine.Also, with the advent of cloud, lightweight servers (I run a small cloud on my home network) we don't need powerhouse laptops anymore if you have supporting infra. When I'm on travel I just VPN into my home network and I have all the resources I need. So keep something light and portable to work from :)\n  \nRead more",

The finish is warm and unique —subtle enough to look professional but different enough to feel special. The build quality is solid, and everything from the keyboard to the touchscreen feels thoughtfully designed. The overall user experience has been smooth and responsive.

You can still run traditional exes built for x86/x64 and it will emulate the instructions to ARM (very cool) and it runs native ARM executables.I'm not a huge fan of its dedicated weird charging port... and I had to get a stronger usb cable for charging and a stronger battery bank that supported the wattage required for this thing to even recognize it as a charger for whatever reason..

After it was it returned it get locking up on restart. Didn't know if it hardware compatibility problems so I went thru one by one eliminated those which meant wiping PC clean and restarting from USB boot drive and reloading. The I starting eliminating software. Finally found that the problem was restoring Pictures and Music files from backup hard drives. Apparently the ARM takes a long time to actually finish copying the data to the C: drive and I was restarting before it was finished. Even though the dialog box shows that process is complete it is still running in the background and it takes like 30 minutes or more to finish copying everything over.  I checked the properties of the input folders to the output and they were the same but the process was still running in the background.  What's the point of a fast processor is it runs like an old XP PC? I would have returned the PC but my return date was 3/3/2025 and when I got all this figured out I was a day late!\n  \nRead more",

The first one arrived with a broken charging cable and NO internal battery. This tablet makes a VERY loud sound coming from the fan, and the battery gets very warm very fast. I need this tablet for school, and I couldn't possibly use this in class as it would be a huge noise distraction. I adjusted the battery to recommended setting, updated, and restarted all like 3 times. Nothing worked. It's going back to this shady company, and I will not purchase anything from them again. They clearly cannot QA/QC...or they just don't care. Huge waste of my time.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I really like this Surface Pro 7. It is exactly as advertised with one exception. The battery life is nowhere near what is advertised. On battery saving mode, using only Onenote for taking class notes, it lasts about 4 hours. Fortunately it charges up very quickly though. I can't see any way that I would get a full days use out of a full battery charge in any circumstance. In my case that is not very important because I am always around an outlet but if you need a tablet that will last all day away from a power source you will have a problem. The camera is good enough, not as good as the Apple camera, but I don't really use it as a camera anyway. I use mostly the 365 programs and find that it integrates these programs seamlessly. Onenote comes with the tablet and has been an amazing app for my vet school classes.  It saves my many hours of study time. My only issues are with the instability of Onenote. It closes itself down every few minutes and is very frustrating. I'm sure there is a fix for this but I'm also sure that I won't get it from Microsorft as they have a technical support team that is on par with the customer service team at the cable company. I've contacted them 3 times now and my issue is never addressed. I was actually told to contact Amazon since they sold it to me. It seems like after spending a thousand dollars on Microsoft products they would at least provide a bit of tech support.  I'll just have to scour the web for a fix to this I guess. Overall I would recommend this tablet to every student. It seems to be a fantastic and fast machine.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Well where do i start..... i ended up getting my item and everything was good for about 20mins of use... however after 20mins my screen would freeze for 10-30 secs. I blew it off at first but then it happen 10mins after then it became a often issue. So i ended up going for an exchange. (The worst idea I’ve ever had). I called up amazon and told them my issue and they were quick to get me a replacement so as first i was satisfied until the surface pro 7 came in the next day. I open the box to find out the box it comes in is not only damage but in a renewed box didn’t even come in the same box it should have come in, then i open that to see the surface pro and the screen film wrapped around it was really dirty as if they dropped it in dirt or so and fingerprints all over the machine. So at this point I’m just hoping it works. This one was not charged at all at 15% like it usually is if you were to buy from Microsoft or an apple device would normally be. So i put it on the charger to find out that it not only has screen tear straight down the middle of the screen but a big red dot half the size of the screen was on there as if they drop the surface pro. So at this point i immediately call amazon and i talked to a representative that ended up giving me a hard time about another replacement even though this one was obviously there fault. So i ended up talking to a supervisor that ended up giving me a hard time as well and in the she said to me that they only do a exchange once but as a one time exception they’ll do the exchange to which i responded with i only want to do the exchange if it’s a brand new product that they are giving me not a renewed one and undamaged. To which she agreed that she would make sure it would be done and put in her notes so the wear house  knows. Well the next day came and guess what.... the man that drops it off throws my package at the wall of my house from a big distance he didn’t see me at all so when i raced over the man jumped in his car and quickly drove away knowing what he did. Not only this but when i open the box the surface pro again was in a dirty renewed box, at this point I’m just hoping it still even worked again no power so i plug it in and guess what it works surprisingly after all that. However i Notice something was different with the boot up process so i knew something was wrong i go to the setting of the computer and the version i bought was 8gb of ram i5 model with 128gb of memory the one i receive as a replacement this time was a 4gb version i5 model with 128gb of memory and GUESS WHAT A DIFFERENT GRAPHICS CARD AS WELL. The surface pro 7 i got not only had 4gb of ram which was wrong but a different graphics card as well that comes in a surface pro 5 are you serious.... so i called up customer service again asking for a supervisor yet again..... just wanting a refund the man told me well i see here that you have a couple of exchange for this device already so i told him this story i am telling now and ask him i wonder why i have “a couple of exchanges” to which he said well instead of a refund i can get you a brand new one and told me how he had to make a couple of phone calls to do this for me so i told him this is the last exchange I’ll be getting ill be asking for a refund next like i previously wanted..if the next one comes in the renewed box which that would mean it’s used.. if it’s broken or the wrong model I’m done with trying and I’m done with the surface pro 7. not only was this the worst experience with amazon that I’ve ever had and worst costumer Service but now I’m going to hate the surface pro 7 because of this. I’ll see what i receive next as of 02/23/2020Sorry for the long review but i felt my experience should be shared for others to see.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "My previous laptop was a godzilla, 15 inch monitor, weighs like 3 pounds or something (2014 model). I was looking for something that had the horsepower for what I needed, but also the lightness to carry it around. Although battery life isnt, the best, I DON'T MIND!This thing is a beast! Im very happy running programs like tableau, zoom, excel, powerpoint, all at the same time and with various files and this thing doesn't even flinch. The first few hours setting up and downloading all the programs it felt a big sluggish and I was starting to get worried. Once that was done, it started to fly.Yes, the rotating screen isnt as flawless as apple's iPad. That said, I bought this not to look pretty, i bought it to be my tool in battle. Being able to run all the programs that a regular PC can run is the main decision I went for Microsoft Surface.  The only downside is that Microsoft is a bit costly on the accessories front.I recommend this piece of tech to anyone who needs to travel or is on the move.  I'm a relatively big guy and i've had no major problem with the size of the keyboard. I do put it FLAT on tables because my keystrokes tend to be pretty hard and the keyboard is the most (in my opinion) fragile of the accessories.Lastly, the Pen interface is not perfect YET but oh man, as a first timer working with it, it kicks total ass and makes note taking in OneNote a complete positive trip.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I am a student-teacher. As such I have to take notes, as well as make lessons for students. This device is fantastic for note-taking and creating documents for schools. The screen is beautiful, and while I wish the bezels were as slim as they were on the surface pro x, I think the bezels are still fine and you tend not to notice them when you're using the device. With a resolution of 2736x1824 (yes, it's a weird resolution) on a 12.3 screen, everything is tack sharp and it has good colour accuracy. I do have a screen calibration tool and did notice quite the difference after calibrating it, but most people will be fine with the base settings.I wouldn't recommend getting the base model (i3 and 4GB ram) since let's be honest, a 4GB ram shouldn't even exist at this point. I think the i5 is the sweet spot, since the i7 isn't really that much better, along with whatever storage option you think you'd need. I'm okay with 256GB. Also, note it does have expandable storage via a micro SD card up to 1TB. The performance on this device is also great about 95% of the time. I get a few weird issues and stutters from time to time, but that is most likely due to windows being windows.The weakest point of this device would definitely be the battery life. While there are worse options out there, I do wish that the battery was slightly better. Having a lot of virtual meetings given the pandemic requires a lot of webcam use and multitasking, and I find that after a couple of hours the battery is already around 30% - with battery-saving mode enabled. When you're not doing that, and you're doing just standard web-browsing and media consumption, you'll be looking at a solid 5-6 hours minimum at acceptable brightness levels.Another negative is that while yes, this device is great, but if you want the full experience, you still have to purchase the type cover, which is another $150+ and the surface pen, which is another $100. So keep in mind that whatever option you choose, you're going to be spending another $300 after taxes.Overall though, writing notes on this device is fantastic, especially if you already use Microsoft 365. I think you can get by with the battery life, and you won't be disappointed by the performance unless you are a heavy user.\n  \nRead more",

La bateria rinde bien y la carga con USB - C le da una ventaja brutal (evidentemente no con un cargador de celular, si no con el de una mac o con el nintendo switch, carga bastante bien).

But after I got it all set up and updated, I realized the WiFi password didn't take because the keyboard had sticky keys and the password was hidden.  I sent it back the same day I got it.

That said, the screen clarity is great and since I prefer MS 365 I am sure the computer will be of good use.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I recently purchased the Microsoft Surface Pro 7 (Renewed) with 256GB storage, i7 processor, and 16GB RAM and had a generally positive experience, though with some caveats.Pros:First, the condition of the device was impressive. As a renewed product, it looked and felt practically new. The 12.3-inch touchscreen is vibrant, responsive, and works well for both productivity and entertainment. The i7 processor and 16GB of RAM ensure smooth performance, even when handling demanding tasks like multitasking and running multiple apps simultaneously. For my daily work needs, the Surface Pro 7 provided solid reliability.The Windows 10 Pro system is easy to navigate, and the portability of the device is perfect for those who need a lightweight but powerful tablet/laptop hybrid. It's excellent for both work and leisure, especially with the sharp display and excellent touch functionality. Additionally, the Wi-Fi connection was stable, and the overall build quality was top-notch.Cons:Unfortunately, I did run into a significant issue with this device. Upon arrival, I noticed that the battery charging did not work. Despite trying several charging cables and outlets, it would not charge beyond a certain point, which was quite frustrating, especially for a device that’s supposed to be fully functional.However, I must commend the return process. The seller made it easy to return the product and issue a full refund, which was a relief. It’s reassuring to know that purchasing a renewed product doesn’t come with a high risk, as the return process was seamless and quick.Overall: While the product itself was in great condition for being refurbished, the battery charging issue was a deal-breaker. Thankfully, the excellent return and refund policy meant that I wasn’t stuck with a faulty device. I’m still interested in purchasing a replacement, but this experience showed me that buying renewed products can come with risks, even if the overall condition seems good.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Just got my Surface Laptop 3 and I'm happy to report when I took it out of the box and inspected it, it looked like a brand new machine.  I was concerned when I ordered it based on the 2 reviews that this listing had, but I guess I lucked out.  The laptop itself is in excellent condition.  The only flaw I could find on the body is a 1mm scratch on one corner that I was able to cover/hide with a black sharpie.  Now you don't even see it.  The screen is absolutely flawless.  The keyboard is flawless.  Sometimes with laptops, over time, the keys get faded or you notice that oily residue on them that doesn't wash off.  This keyboard looks like it's never been used.  The trackpad is perfect.  The only thing I can't speak to is the battery life remaining.  The \"excellent\" condition by this seller states that the battery is supposed to be above 80% life.  I've charged it fully and discharged it 2 times so far and it seems like the battery is fine.  All the ports work fine and I updated it to Windows 11 without issue.  The laptop came with a power adapter and that's all.  It was packed inside an inflatable bubble wrap and was well protected.  Seller shipped via Fed-ex 2 day shipping for free.  All in all, no complaints.  Very happy.  I did notice that the price fluctuates on this model from this seller.  Sometimes it's a little higher or lower than what I paid.  Not sure why.\n  \nRead more",

The only problem is the included AC adapter is bad…luckily i had an adapter from the computer I was replacing. I used the poor Amazons chat customer service to let them know the PC worked but the ac adapter was bad, and all I needed was a replacement ac adapter. They said ok, a day later I get a approved refund request which I never asked for, all I need is the ac adapter for the computer, no reason the seller should have to replace the entire pc. I needed a pc since mine died, otherwise I wouldn’t have ordered it, I don’t want a refund. If the only way to get a replacement adapter through Amazons poor customer service is to replace the entire computer I’ll just go without and leave a bad review. I am happy to update this bad review if seller can resolve the issue that Amazon has actually made worse.\n  \nRead more",

My only issue is the charger, the magnet is not as strong as Mac's MagSafe chargers so it does come disconnected easily.

                "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    4 Stars vs Surface Pro series, but as the smallest, least expensive Surface, it is 5 Stars",
                "review": "I'm a big fan of both the 12.3\" Surface Pro (note: current screens are a little larger) and of the mini-me Go lineup. I own one of each of the first three editions of the Go (Go 1 w/10.1\"; and the 10.5\" Go 2 and Go 3). The latest Go 4 is sold through business channels only and hasn't shown up on any used websites yet.What I like (and don't like) about all the Go's:* Killer screen resolution and quality, definitely Amazon Prime-worthy. In settings, I increase the normal display from 150% to 175% for easier reading. You will want to stick with 150% if you have sharp vision and want to split the screen into two windows (I treat my Go's like an iPad, one full window at a time, and just switch windows to cut and paste or see another active program.* Infrared and visible light (camera) combine for highly secure facial scan log-ins. Microsoft wisely recommends using a PIN, custom password for this device, or the facial login so peepers (visual surveillance in real time or through security cameras) can't capture your Microsoft account log-in details. I find the system the the Surface uses to be the most trustworthy (imho equal to Apple facial recognitionand far superior to Android)* Front firing stereo speakers with good clarity (out of tiny slits on the left and right upper corners). Much better than Apple iPad's side-firing edge speakers.* Centrally located front and rear cameras, a good location for video calls. However, in my experience, the iPad 9 and 10 have a far superior microprocessor that provides much better video quality without stuttering. This isn't Microsoft's fault, it's Intel for falling so far behind Apple's in-house design custom chips. At least Microsoft got the camera lens locations perfect from day one, compared to Apple's awkward location on the middle of the side edge (until the iPad 10).* Anti-fall recharging - Microsoft uses a magnetically clamping on power connector that won't yank the table to the floor if you trip on the power cable. It also uses POGO conductive \"dots\" which means there is no \"port\" (plug hole) to get mangled over time and leave you unable to charge your tablet.* The single USB C port WILL also charge the tablet; in fact the Apple 18 watt C and Anker 18 or 20 watt C, chargers will easily re-charge the Surface Go even while you use it.* Screen shape is optimized for full-screen windows, with plenty of width for a normal typewriter page, and extra height compared to the wide angle screens on Android tablets and on most Windows and Chrome laptops. It is the same \"aspect ratio\" as it's bigger brothers, the Surface Pro's.* THAT BUILT-IN KICKSTAND. I've been waiting for years for a kickstand on the iPads, which I also love. First, you don't need an accessory case or cover so you can prop up the tablet on a desk or counter; all you need to do is fold out the kickstand. Second, if is VERY stable unlike an iPad screen cover folded to the rear into a little unstable triangle. And, unlike the iPad case covers and screen covers, you have a wide variety of viewing angles - continuously variable, not just a few clickable positions.* The factor keyboard requires no charging. The factory keyboard is illuminated. No \"pairing\" is required because the hinge on the factory keyboard magnetically snaps on to the bottom edge of the tablet and directly connects via the conductive POGO dots on the tablet and spikes on the keyboard.* There are more than 4  accessory keyboards to choose from. I have used Arteck, Inateck, and Omoton and they are all satisfactory - snap on magnetically just like the factory keyboard, but pair using Buetooth. The Omoton is preferred, in addition to being backlighted, it recharges with a C cable, instead of the now-obsolete Micro USB - so one less cable and perhaps one less charger (modern charges are C on both ends, the transition era of A on the charger and C on the cable end are over, although A=>C is how Amazon still ships their Fire tablets).* The clip-on accessory keyboards also cover and protect the screen while in transit.* On this Go TWO only (plus the later two models), the margins around the screen are narrower than on the Go 1, and the screen is .4\" bigger.* The Go's all accept Micro SD cards, and you can go into settings and change the default file locations from the small 64gb internal storage (typically 11gb-25gb available) to the Micro SD card; I use a 256gb Samsung at $18 from Amazon for this purpose (I can only recommend Samsung, Patriot, and Sandisk). I strongly recommend Samsung, just look for A1 or A2 class for better performance, it doesn't run fast then slow down as it heats up, unlike some competitors.* ONLY THE Go 2-Go 4 RUN WINDOWS 11. This is critical since Microsoft is discontinuing security updates for Windows 10 at the end of this year.* Microsoft's current support for Word's online only version is superb; I no longer have to download either the shorter app version or longer full-version.*eMMC vs SSD vs EFS - the Go 1-3 models with 64gb hard drives use eMMC storage, which is a souped up micro SD card system. The Go 1-3 models with 128gb and up hard drives use full laptop and desktop grade SSD's. The Go 4 models, regardless of storage capacity, use UFS, which is  super-souped up micro SD card system. Supposedly, EFS is almost as fast as a low-end SSD but uses less power and takes up less space. According to test reports, the Go 1-3 with SSD's installed had way faster bulk file transfer speeds, and because they can read/write at the same time, better results in other key areas of performance. HOWEVER in typical use scenarios - YouTube, Spotify, writing - there was no subjective difference in performance.* There are some good deals on Amazon Renewed Surface Go 2's. A lot of companies and some schools use Go's instead of iPads, and close them out on regular cycles. It's not time for inexpensive Go 3's yet. In most cases, if you purchase a used Go 2, it will be a business model and will boot into Pro Windows (although you will need to manually update (by clicking a button) to Windows 11).Let's hit some negatives:* 64gb can end up with 11gb or so left for working space, if you go through all the updates after purchase (including updating to Windows 11). While the operating system is set to erase no-longer needed files monthly, I go into Settings=>Sytem=> Storage and click on Temporary Files and manually delete \"Prior Windows Installations\" to get my available storage back up to 25-30gb.* Multiple browsers eat up storage. I use just Edge and DuckDuckGo browsers; Edge is pre-installed, DuckDuckGo is either on the Microsoft Store or web.* I recommend charging separately. If I charge while using it, it develops a hot spot all the way across the top half. Intel really has some catching up to do with Apple and Android/ARM/Chromebooks on ARM in terms of heat and battery life.* Battery life is as little as 4 hours while watching YouTube or streaming services (as much as 7 hours on Google Docs or Microsoft Word online).* There's no such thing as a simple screen cover. It's keyboard cover, or hit the road jack.Recommendations.+ If you find the right size Dockem, a simple but very useful envelope style protetive cover, they work very well. You have to oversize them properly to allow for the keyboard cover. I suggest measuring things but add .5\" to the size Dockem specs show; or get the next size up from iPad Pro 11 size. Of course you can cheap out and use an Amazon shipping bubble envelope instead, which is more low key through TSA and has your name and address on it for I.D.+ It's a touch screen, but even for videos I use the trackpad on the keyboard so I'm not always get finger print smudges.+ If it's only $30-50 more, 128gb is a more relaxed way to go.+ The built-in security software is very good imho; in 20 years I've stuck with it. However go into Security Settings and make sure Device Security is turned on in hardware options, and make sure you have Enhanced Hardware Security active.+ Don't give up if the initial setup and security updates and upgrade to Windows 11 seems to take forever; it does. Just do it on the kitchen counter while you do other stuff and otherwise respond to its occasional pleas for inputs from you. It is NOT as efficient as updating an iPad. But only the first experience is so bad it hurts. Thereafter, pretty painless+ Your reward is the most compatible operating system on the planet. With iPads and even Chromebooks, sometimes I want to pull my hair out with weird webpage glitches. Never with Windows.\n  \nRead more",

It seemed at first to be in excellent condition until I took off my sunglasses, that’s when I noticed the scuff mark in the body and some type of tacky residue on the back. I’ve cleaned off the tacky residue, which was only in a couple spots, but discovered the scuff since I couldn’t clean it off. This was sold as Refurbished Excellent and it clearly isn’t in excellent condition and some money should be credited back.Update: While using this today, it wasn’t hot as it was normal use on Internet, the screen flickered showing scrambled multi color vertical lines for less than a second each time. Obviously, if they had actually checked this item they would’ve definitely known it isn’t excellent condition. I’m obviously returning this item, shipped tomorrow. I attempted to reset to factory but the seller messed up the Windows 11 install and files were missing so I couldn’t reset to factory; I had to download a factory image from Microsoft which restored it to Windows 10. Upon completing the restore it asked for a login for Livonia Public Schools. I contacted the IT department at the school for a generic login and the following is the email I received back…I'm not sure who you bought this from on Amazon, but I would contact them and return the device. We were not paid for these and the recycler did not have our permission to resell these devices.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I had originally purchased an off brand tablet for about 100 dollars less than this one. As you would expect, it was garbage. It was slow, unreliable and just a perfect example of why buying \"Chinese off brand\" products is hit or miss.When I got my Surface (a full 7 days earlier than expected) I was absolutely blow away by the difference 100 dollars made. It arrived looking absolutely brand new. Honestly, the seller probably could have passed it off as new if they chose to.Setup was pretty straightforward, it runs Windows 10 and it's set to the desktop version so if you have a PC or laptop running Win10, there's almost no learning curve.The speakers are great considering the size of the tablet. Crisp clear sounds. I doubt I'll use it much for video but it's nice to know I can. The screen is clear and easy to read. The touch screen function might take a little getting used to as the OS isn't designed around that aspect, but it's not a big deal. Worst case scenario you can easily use a bluetooth mouse/keyboard.I can't comment on the battery life yet, but so far it doesn't seem like it'll be much of an issue.I bought this primarily for use in a course I'm taking so mostly word processing and web searching, and I don't forsee any issues in that regard.All said and done, buying refurbished electronics can be a little daunting at times, but I'm 100 percent happy with this particular purchase as well as the seller.\n  \nRead more",

I got the Device Manager clean as a whistle.  You can use this USB stick to restore the system if it ever gets wiped out by malware or ransomware - just keep all your data in the cloud and your are bullet-proof.  After you build the system you can then sell it for money, as long as you include the Windows USB stick and the Key.  If you try to build many machines with the one USB stick and key you will find problems.  All that said - Windows 11 is not the best OS out there - but it's the one everyone expects.

Since I am a registered owner of Windows 10, it latched onto my Win10 license and used it as an upgrade. My Win 11 product key is unused, bonus! So far I haven't experienced any issues or errors. With the SSD, from power on to login screen is 7 seconds! Amazing. Not wild about the PIN instead of a password thing. Still exploring the new features, so I may update my review in the future. All in all, happy with the product so far.Update: A month and a half in, still working as advertised. Maybe M$ finally got an OS correct lol\n  \nRead more",

It is a pain and unless you are using it for an application where you have IT support you likely don’t need one.The PC is dying despite the advantages of its form factor and it is all Microsoft’s fault. They got a monopoly then used the power to make the user experience worse with every edition since at least Windows 7 and probably Windows XP remains the high point for Windows.The process of setting it up should be Microsoft’s chance to shine. Make a good first impression by having a product that just works. Instead you are stuck wasting time because you don’t have hardwired internet and have to lug the computer to the router. Then it doesn’t want to let you install without a Microsoft account. Then you buy the kids a game, and of course it remembers your credit card so they can easily order whatever they want without asking for the card. Not even a the dignity of a check box to not remember the card!The only consolation of a painful few hours setting up a computer is that this horrible user experience has driven the PC into collapse. I asked my wife if she wanted one along with my kids and while she had one for years in the bright days of Windows XP, she didn’t really care to get off her phone long enough to use a computer.\n  \nRead more",

The feature that stands out from this device is the ability to replace the 2230 SSD, but not all SSDs of this type are compatible, it is not compatible with the WD Black SN770MM M.2 2230 and others. I cannot make a return since I am outside the USA, in general I am very disappointed to have used my savings in this purchase to use as a school computer, I will never buy refurbished equipment again\n  \nRead more",

I assumed some scratches on the outside of it like the back or whatever, and it has some of those. But that's fine, no big deal. I assumed it might even have some minor chips or scratches in the glass screen around the edges, and there were, but again no big deal. What I was not expecting was multiple dead patches of pixels on the screen. I certainly wouldn't call that \"good\" condition when little scattered parts of the screen don't work. It's condition is \"ok\" at best. So I'm more than a little disappointed. And the charger that was sent with it must have also been refurbished too, but very poorly. When plugged in, it makes an incredibly loud humming sound that can be heard across the room, and that can be felt in your hand if you pick it up. So careful about what your getting, because their definition of \"good\" is just barely passable. Wishing I spent the extra money to just buy a new one.\n  \nRead more",

I recommend an anti-glare (matte finish) screen protector to control fingerprints and give a nice feeling writing surface if you use the pen.Also a big reason to pick a 7+ over just a 7 is this is a later gen processor so big improvements there, also the SSD is easily expandable, I'll be able to take this surface from 126G to 1TB storage for less than $100 makes this an easy choice.If I have any issues in the future I'll update the review, overall super happy purchase.\n  \nRead more",

There was no problem downloading my photoshop but the tablet has a mid-screen invisible line that does not pick up drawings. The midline remains blank and there is a jarring jump from top to bottom of it (and usually to left or right) when you try to draw across the center of the screen, making it pretty much unusable for that purpose. At first I thought it was the screen protector, then the digital pen, but after changing all of those it's obviously the tablet that is is defective.

However, I was taking a chance on this for a work trip because I didn’t want to lug my big laptop around.#1 the charger was not cleaned at all and it definitely grossed me out.#2 the charger only works in certain positions, this is not at all “like new” or “excellent condition”#3 the screen has damaged pixels which are decidedly not “excellent” condition or even “like new”The device itself was cleaned. But I would’ve rather paid for a new surface pro. I’m really disappointed and honestly going to be attempting to return. I took numerous videos of my unboxing and first time experience. If I could have uploaded more than 1 video I definitely would have.I’m sure everyone will not have the same experience as I. Just how about don’t lie about your product? Plenty of people would be happy with something like this but at a cheaper price. A damaged screen, unclean charger, and hardware that has to be fixed in a certain position to charge is definitely not “like new”, “excellent”, or even “refurbished”. Cool you wiped the device and threw it in a box. I’m not impressed.\n  \nRead more",

You absolutely want 8 GB of ram and the Core M3 chip to get a half way fluid desktop experience. The 4gb and Pentium gold version functions but it chokes so much even webbrowsing while downloading updates is janky and that makes it hard to use as a \"normal computer\". 128 GB is really also what you need as the 64gb version will have so much space taken up by windows, windows install files and hybernation files you will have to constantly juggle things to store more than a dozen GB unless you use a Microsoft card.Disable the fancy visual effects and it's just a very solid experience. Battery life is solid and the built in kickstand works great. Is it/should it be stuck with Windows 10? Yes, basically, but that's fine for the near future. If you have fixed needs this is just wonderfully \"good enough\"\n  \nRead more",

It just seems like charging is such a basic function  I don’t know how the hell it was the thing that was missed by these “experts”.Edit: Best Buy are the real hero’s here. Was able to get the problem diagnosed. Amazon wouldn’t even send me a replacement charger, even tho it was established the initial one was faulty. So much for a warranty.Over all good price- but you might spend a little more time and money covering for amazons “experts”\n  \nRead more",

The Surface Pro 4 was purchased and left in box as a backup until needed. It was stored in a climate controlled office with other similar equipment.  It will only stay on when plugged in. Once you pull the plug, it turns off, so the battery is useless.  It also doesn't boot up normally.  Though I did not find these issues out until after the warranty period, I called Lifecycle Pro to see what we could work out.  I was willing to send back the tablet at my expense to have them fix the battery issue, or I was also willing to send it back and get a store credit on another tablet. Its my fault for not checking the condition of the device when it was received, so I get it. It was in the original box and not opened, so the problems it has now, would've been there upon receipt. I would've offered a customer some level of credit or something...Lifecycle Pro offered nothing.  Considering the 2 tablets I have purchased from them are of little to no value, They made a few hundred, offered subpar tech, and definitely lost our business.\n  \nRead more",

This battery lasts half the time my pro 3 did and is slower than my pro 3.I'm disappointed with it, but it gets the job done. Well, as long as I cool it down and give it a rest when it begins to flicker and am a little patient with it.Honestly, I get more things done and faster on my Samsung phone which replaces most computers (unlike iphones....sorry had to put that in there ;p).Best if you go with Pro 7 or 8 and make monthly payments instead.

I literally ordered one the next day! I had been in the market for a new tablet, and thought maybe I wanted an iPad, but I just couldn't seem to pull the trigger. I don't like the mobile interface of apple products (despite loving the desktop interface on my iMac). I had a Galaxy Tab 2, which I liked for a while, but I also don't really love the Android interface for a tablet, although I love it for my phone. So, this has been the perfect solution. It's a laptop, but a tablet, but a laptop. It's just frickin' amazing. I also really like Windows 10. I stopped following Windows products when Windows 8 came out, but 10 has been a nice blend of 7 and 8. This really is the best of all worlds!\n  \nRead more",

I buy these frequently as replacements because they burn out in hot industrial environments or freeze when a customer tries too often to restart without the password.  These refurbs start up fine, appear as near new, have good battery life and function...  If you need a low cost tablet, this is a good option.

It's a Surface Pro 6, so it doesn't have the newer USB-C connection - but that's fine for me, as I find USB-A just a little more convenient (bearing in mind that this isn't a primary computer for my family, but a casual tablet).Also, please note the price - I got this for a mite under $500, which makes it exceptional value today (early 2020), blowing the ~$400 Surface Go out of the water.Mine was \"renewed\" from Mastertronics, and everything looked good. The box had some rather large stickerage on it to make it clear it was renewed. Out of the box it wanted to run first-time W10 setup. After that, checking the battery showed that it had been cycled seven times already (good! Not EXCELLENT, but good!).There's not really much else to say that hasn't been covered by countless SP6 reviews. These renewed ones come without the excellent Type Cover or stylus, it's worth noting. It's a lovely, premium-feeling slab of tablet, without being too heavy (I can't even feel it in my backpack when it goes there in place of my ~2.1KG Acer R7-571 laptop). Battery life is good. So... that's it! $500 is such a bargain for a quality little machine like this, and in my case, the \"renewed\" version was completely problem-free.\n  \nRead more",

Also, the processor was not an I5 8400T.  While using windows, the brown spots turned into white spots and it was very annoying and unbearable to look at. We looked up troubleshooting tips to see if it was something that can be reset. It was recommended on Microsoft site to enter into UEFI mode and if the issue appears there, then it points to screen damage. We unfortunately did not take pictures and decided to have it replaced as the listing from Amazon does say it was eligible for a refund or replacement.We tried to setup an exchange but it told us that our product was not eligible for a return and that we had to contact Amazon. We did so and they informed us we had to return it an order another. Well that is not an exchange but a return. So what is the point of advertising that they offer the ability to exchange? We called back and a supervisor was able to setup the exchange. So we shipped back the item, same day, and a few days later, received the second Surface. WellllllCosmetically it was in worse shape then the first. But we were really not that upset about the exterior and it was going in a case anyway. However, we turned it on and was greeted to the exact same type of burn in white/brown spots (this time we took pictures, albeit not AS bad, but still very noticeable. This time we did the same things as the first unit and just went through windows setup and check to see if its working at all which lead to the next big problem with this unit, the touch screen was messed up. This is going to be kind of hard to show in pictures/video but the top part of the screen does not respond to touch inputs. So I used the tool to calibrate the touch and pen inputs and to no luck, it did not fix it. As someone who will be using this as a tablet more then a laptop, this was way more impossible to overlook then the burn in spots. Now that nothing about this product was in Excellent condition as described in the listing, we at least checked to make sure the specs are correct and things are running correctly to find that the CPU in our unit was not as the one described once again. This time the CPU was an i5-8350U.I would completely understand if the first unit we got was messed up and that mistakes happen or that this unit unfortunately got damaged in shipping, however the 2nd unit being messed up in the same exact manner raises a lot of questions and suspicion. I have a very hard time believing that this company is refurbishing these units when the first step after working on the product should be to turn on the unit and make sure everything is working. There is just no way I can imagine how you just glance over these screen and other issues TWICE. We are extremely disappointed and angry about this whole situation. See pictures and video.\n  \nRead more",

Delivered, unboxed, removed and returned  all with in 3 hours.  But after a quick conversation I had a replacement  mailed out and received it in 2 days.  That one was in perfect working condition.  The power cord however was broken this time.  Again another quick conversation and they sent out a replacement cord.  Received that within another 2 days.  End the end it was a tiny Hassel but I got the product and everything works well and as it should.  Take a chance.  These guys will take care of you.  It's appears clean. Looks good.

A tip of the hat to Amazon for at least grading each renewed item into one of three categories. I chose to purchase the top category which is \"Excellent Condition,\" and indeed it is. The Surface 6 that I received is like new in every way except the packaging. The packaging is very good, but not the original box. Most importantly, the Surface 6 works perfectly and I cannot find even one small scratch on it. Your mileage may vary, but I think if you stick with \"excellent condition'\" then you'll be well satisfied. If not, you can take advantage of Amazon's generous return policy.\n  \nRead more",

This is just a feeling that I have in my gut that this laptop isn't on the up and up there is something fishy with this purchase and I intend to sort it out . I take it very personal when somebody tries to take advantage of me and I will not rest until I get it figured out. That being said this laptop is extremely slow. In fact it is so slow it is almost unusable. I have performed a factory reset twice thus far and it runs fine at first but then a couple days later it's back to the way it was. It only does this when I'm connected to the internet. Service speed tested at or around 1gig.  . However if I'm not connected to the internet it's fine. I bought the same model years ago when it first came out. it still runs just a Snappy as it did on day one. I was so impressed with this laptop that I went and bought a refurbished one from here on Amazon.  I will say if I had the option to purchase one new I would have purchased One new but they no longer make this model so I was forced to buy a refurbished model from here on Amazon. for some reason a couple days in to the purchase, it starts running really slow. it won't upload or download things very quickly at all takes forever to open simple web pages on a 1gig web connection and I'm not having this issue with any other device. I start to wonder if they replaced components for off-brand components or something. I really dont know but Something simply  isn't right with this laptop.  I would not recommend anyone spend money on one of these \"REFURBISHED\" laptops. You're better off putting the money towards A new one.\n  \nRead more",

We’ve always been a Mac family, but have moved away from it due to the high-dollars that mac wants for a new machine.For the money, this computer has it all.  It’s a laptop and a tablet in one package, it boots quickly, operates flawlessly...  there’s really not much to dislike.If there were one thing I could improve, it’d be the battery life in the tablet portion.  It’s not that long-lasting.  However, one thing that nobody seems to mention is that the power adapter plugs into the tablet portion, as well.So, if you’re looking to save literally thousands over buying both a Mac and an iPad, and don’t mind windows or the lessened tablet battery life, this is an excellent choice.I’d recommend it, but with those aforementioned disclaimers.\n  \nRead more",

One of the Book 2 was running a fragmented version of Windows 11 Home (something the i5 7300 CPU is not certified for by MS) and the OS reported the License was in use on another device. This machine also came with a under powered 65 watt aftermarket power supply that ran hot. The second machine looked as good as the first but it to had OS issues. It was running Windows 10 pro but Windows Update would not successfully apply the latest feature updates that MS said were available for the machine. I suspect another corrupted reimaging was done by the refurb vendor. They are really hurting the Amazon program!I ordered a second set of machines from another vendor for a few $ more.

I have coveted the Microsoft Surface range for years, but too pricey for me.  But when I needed a replacement laptop for my HP whose battery has failed yet again, I decided to look at a refurbed Surface.  Settled on a Book model for its flexibility with the removable screen.In terms of what was supplied, I was slightly disappointed in getting a unit with a ding in the screen casing in what was described as in \"excellent\" condition  (I have used Amazon Warehouse/Renewed for years and everything has looked like brand new).  The Laptop also came with totally discharged batteries which was also a surprise to see.But putting these two aside, after leaving to charge, I proceeded to complete the Windows installation, then upgrade to Windows 11 and then checked the spec of what was supplied.  I found I had the faster optional processor, twice the RAM expected and twice as large an SSD as expected, so a great result there which makes up for the screen ding.Had the laptop for just the 3 days but very happy with it.  Already bought some extras like the Surface Dock and USB-VGA and USB-HDMI adapters for the Dock so I can use as a Desktop replacement as well as a Laptop-cum-Tablet.only thing that is bugging me is the left shift key is a single key size and I keep hitting the \"\\\" instead of the shift, but I will get used to that.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "So I bought this laptop refurbished, which was new to me. I guess I was worried I'd get a beat up piece of used gear. Instead, this laptop came and seemed like it was absolutely brand new. The price was incredible for this laptop, which made it a solid chance to take. I recently bought a far more expensive Dell XPS 13 and it has been a complete pain. There are so many strange bugs and compatibility issues, and I felt like I wasted my money a bit. At this point, Microsoft and Apple are making amazing products that give you the best experience with their operating systems, and this Surface Laptop provided a wonderfully streamlined experience with no bloatware or bugs. I have been using it for months now and it has been so reliable and free of any issues. I also wanted to take advantage of the incredible Ryzen mobile processors with the AMD graphics, and though its not a gaming powerhouse, it has run all sorts of fun games. This is just a bonus. I would highly recommend this computer for work or school, as its value far exceeds the cost.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I utilized this computer for a few weeks as my primary computer. It was outstanding overall, great battery life, great screen, great sound.I loved the finish of the keyboard, but because it was not metal, there was a very weak, flexible spot on the left of the keyboard. I consistently had missed keys and it slowed my typing. This is nit-picky but for an expensive laptop, you should expect little or no flex on basic typing.I also personally wanted to find a windows laptop as portable as my MacBook Pro M1, and decided to try the Microsoft Laptop Go 2. Battery life is about the same, screen similar, and decent sound quality. The keyboard is identical, except on a metal chassis, and has no flex.\n  \nRead more",

En mi caso llego con detalles esteticos un ligero raspon/golpe en una esquina que si bien no afecta su funcionalidad es notorio. En cuanto al OS tuve que descargar la imagen desde microsoft por lo cual es importante cuenten con el serial del equipo ya que este les habilita absolutamente todas las descargas que la surface llegara a necesitar.Despues de poco mas de 6 meses de uso moderado (office, web browsing, streaming services) la bateria aun me permite usarla poco mas de 6 horas con una carga y seguro puede alargarse con el ahorro de energía. El cargador es original y todos sus puertos llegaron en excelentes condiciones. Por los detalles estéticos es evidente que no es nueva sin embargo las teclas, el trackpad y los puertos no presentan el mas mínimo detalle de desgaste.Buena compra tomando en cuenta que es reconstruida y con descuento adicional. Excelente opción para un uso básico, comodo y autónomo ya que si esta buscando conectarla a un docking para multiples perifericos y/o monitores externos 4k se sobre calentara hasta apagarse. Sin embargo por si misma es suficiente para un uso personal moderado.\n  \n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I bought the Microsoft Surface Pro 9 Tablet recently to replace the HP Pavilion desktop that I purchased about five years ago.  My HP Pavilion had similar specs to the Microsoft Surface Pro 9 including the same Core i7 chip. I haven't bought a new computer in years, and I have to say I'm extremely impressed. The Surface Pro 9 basically does everything my old HP Pavilion desktop did (and a lot more) in a slim tablet that's just a fraction of its size. The Surface Pro 9 boots up very fast, in just seconds actually. I love the touch-screen functionality which is very useful. The screen is brilliant and vibrant and colorful, perfect for Youtube, Netflix, etc.  The internal hard drive is small, but I have an external 4Tbyte hard drive that I connect to it so that solves that problem. I'd recommend a similar fix if you're not happy about the small hard drive. The Surface Pro 9 is portable, quiet and doesn't generate a lot of heat. You can buy external docking station (as I did) for $30 that will physically connect to the Surface Pro 9 and add lots of connectable ports for USB drives, external drives, an HDMI cable, etc. Also, don't forget to buy an external keyboard both to protect the screen and for laptop functionality. The Microsoft Surface Pro 9 is a real little workhorse that effortlessly replaces a desktop - and it's lightweight and portable too!  The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because this thing just gobbles up electrical charge. The manufacturer claims it runs on a fully-charged battery for up to 15 hours. Not in my experience, no way. In my experience you'll be lucky if you get even half that time on a fully-charged battery. Of course, the Surface Pro 9 comes with a charger, but you're going to find that you need to be near an electrical outlet most of the time or this thing will run down its battery real fast. Just saying. Other than that, the Microsoft Surface Pro 9 is a great machine and a great buy. Highly recommended.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "When I was on the search for a new laptop, I was debating on whether to switch to macbook after being a window user for years because I really like the aesthetic of the macbook but when I came across this laptop, I was immediately drawn to it because it looks exactly like a macbook but with a windows operating system and so far I really like it!Since it's much smaller than my older 15.6 inch laptop, it will definitely take some time for me to get used to it but I like how lighter it is and it was also really easy to set up.The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars though is because the second time I went on it to watch a live stream, the audio kept making static/crackly noises and the problem continued when I tried watching YouTube videos, but now the third time I used it, I didn't really hear any static sounds so I don't know what was up with that, but I figure it's probably a software issue that might be easily resolved by updating the computer.Also this laptop isn't the most powerful so don't expect to use it to play games. I got the laptop just to write books on and do basic web browsing so I don't mind it not being super powerful.Regarding the overheating issue, it does get hot when you let it sit on top of a blanket but if you sit it on carpet or a desk, it doesn't get as hot.Either way, I highly recommend this laptop if you're looking for something inexpensive that looks like a macbook!\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I needed a laptop for pretty basic needs:  writing Word Docs, sending emails, paying bills, filing my taxes.  I wanted something simple, and a laptop that is fast.  In the past, I've used Dell, and they were frustratingly slow.  What I love most about this laptop is:  (1) incredibly easy to set up and transfer everything over from my old laptop, utilizing my Microsoft account; (2) small, light, and sharp looking; (3) being able to use either the cursor or touch screen, and (4) its fast.  The only drawbacks I have experienced thus far are: (1) because of the small screen, sometimes when I'm accessing online forms to fill out, some of the form is outside the window, and I am unable to adjust things to make it appear/fit in.  This doesn't happen too often, but when it does, it's frustrating; (2) sometimes, when I'm operating the laptop on battery power, the screen is very dark and I can barely see it; and when I've tried to adjust the brightness, it doesn't help, so the only solution is to plug it in, which increases the brightness of the screen; and (3) given the small screen size, the font is hard to see; but that was my choice when purchasing this, and you CAN expand the window with your fingers on the screen, so you can overcome that.  It's only been about a month, but all in all I've been very pleased.\n  \nRead more",

This allows a local ID set up.  After I went in and disabled the WIFI card I was able to get ito the system.  After the the start up issue the machine works as expected.

                "review": "The product came in okay condition with about 76% battery life remaining. Some scratches around the edges where tools were used and other marks indicating wear. Seems more like a fair or good condition item.It’s smaller than a 2020 IPad Pro, so quite a lot more portable.My particular Surface was missing its keyboard and pen, despite amazon labeling this device as “excellent” which amazon determines this item should have its pen and type cover-witness marks of both items are present on this device.Amazon renewed uses a dated reformatting system to wipe the product clean before shipping ‘renewed’ which causes some issues. Firstly, it gets reformatted with tech for a windows PC, not a surface. This causes issues with the on screen keyboard not appearing (this can be counteracted in accessibility settings for a more difficult to use on screen keyboard) and long press right click being disabled.To remedy these issues, Microsoft has a guide for resetting surface devices using their files and a 16+GB USB drive. If you can format a hard drive and run settings, you’ll do great.Otherwise, this little tablet/laptop is decent for school. I’d recommend ensuring you have the budget for a keyboard cover and surface pen on top of this device.\n  \nRead more",

Upon further investigation, I discovered that there is no Surface Pro with an i5 8400T as described. Despite this, the tablet is reasonably priced and performs well. I would recommend potential buyers to ensure they are comfortable with the i5-8350U processor if they decide to order it. Additionally, it's advisable to check for updated descriptions before making a purchase, as the discrepancy in the processor information may not have been rectified.\n  \nRead more",

I chose a refurbished device to perhaps save some money and keep an old, but otherwise useful, device from the landfill.I wish the absolute lemon of a device I received was in a landfill.Appearances were, at first, good. As standard for used devices it shipped with no documentation, only a power cord. It was wrapped and shipped quite well, and it was clearly cleaned before shipment. There was only one very tiny (less than 1mm in length) chip in the metal case which took me some time to notice. In terms of external quality the device looked excellent. Unfortunately, the excellent outsides belied the irredeemable insides.The device was nearly inoperable, and is utterly beyond saving by a normal user. When performing first time set up problems quickly became apparent. Touch controls did not work for this touch screen tablet computer. The device came without a pen or keyboard, and I was fine with this as I did not expect a used device to come with peripherals. However what was not fine was the fact that the device would not register touch inputs outside of the \"power+volume up\" menu. Touching would not move the cursor, touching would not bring up the on screen keyboard, touching the *touch surface* of this Surface Pro tablet did nothing whatsoever.Fine, perhaps the device expects you to have a keyboard or some other peripheral. I plugged in a USB mouse and was able to, with some difficulty, complete first time start up and connect my device to my internet. My problems were not yet over.Now on the windows desktop home screen new problems set in. I attempted to update the system - as I thought perhaps an update to the device's software would correct the device's issues. Here I ran into something rather novel, the settings menu would not open. No matter how many times I clicked, no matter how many resets I performed, I could not open the settings menu in order to update the device. I tried sifting through the menus to try to find some setting or other that might turn on touch controls, or otherwise render my device operable but, alas, nothing.At this point, frustrated with the increasingly useless device I had spent $274 on, I resolved to try a factory reset. As the settings menu obstinately resisted any attempt to bring it up, I brought up the command prompt and (still using a usb mouse and the on screen keyboard) entered \"systemreset\".Enter the final, most damning, issue with this device - the battery. During multiple attempts at a system reset the device blue screened. The issue, I suspect, is the battery which cannot hold a charge. The device, by some miracle, shipped with the correct power cable. The cable was apparently the only thing about the device that could handle electricity. The machine holds no charge and instantly turns off the moment the cable is unplugged. The battery, I suspect, is fully cooked, or somehow removed. In any case, the machine would be useless for my intended purposes in such a state, even if the touch controls worked at all.In summation the machine I was sent:1. Would not respond to touch inputs2. Would not load key functions on the operating system3. Blue screened several times4. Had a battery life of approximately 0 secondsUsed and refurbished electronics are always a \"your mileage may vary\" proposition - especially in sight unseen purchases like over Amazon. Based on other reviews many people are happy with the devices they received, and you might be too should you order from Amazon Refurbished. I warn you, however, that your mileage might be like mine: a beautiful condition but useless device with an even more useless battery.\n  \nRead more",

Disconnecting from power cable resulted in immediate shut down regardless of how long it was attached.Large region of the touchscreen was damaged. It interferes with basic typing and makes some letters unusable in the default layout. I used the Paint program to check the scope of the damage. There was a region, a few cm wide, that stretched the entire length of the screen where touch inputs were lost or distorted.Product was not in acceptable condition despite being certified. I requested a replacement and will update this review when it arrives.Follow-up Review:I received a replacement which had more cosmetic damage but had a functioning battery and touchscreen. Much happier with the replacement. Be sure to test yours thoroughly when it arrives!\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I love Amazon and I love buying refurbished, so when we needed several of these as security camera monitors, this seemed like a great solution. We bought them a couple at a time over the course of several months, and from different sellers, and all but ONE were lemons. Fortunately, we discovered it before Amazon's generous return window on all but one of them, so we're only out the cost of one of these. Most of them had screen problems that weren't apparent until it was used continuously for an hour or more. Some of them were clearly heat-related issues that could be temporarily resolved by not using the screen for a while or by putting them in the fridge briefly, though that of course is not an acceptable state of affairs for a Surface.One of them had a non-OEM screen that had clearly been replaced, and it was about 1/2 or 1/3 the dpi of what the device should have. It was like looking at a laptop screen from twenty years ago through a screen door, and it was obvious that someone scamming Amazon. In that instance, clearly nobody at Amazon had even turned it on to attempt to vet it, because the comically low DPI was blatantly obvious as soon as the screen displayed anything at all at startup.Amazon was accommodating at taking them all back within the lengthy return window, which I appreciated, but it's clear that there are a number of people sending Amazon devices they claim are good which are clearly not. 1 good one out of 6 is not a good success rate, and we lost several hundred dollars on the one whose screen failed after a few months (beyond the return window). I don't know what processes Amazon has for \"refurbishing\" these, but whatever it is, it's not working very well. I won't buy any more of these from Amazon.\n  \nRead more",

The speed and performance is still good. After a year, the charging cable no longer connected dependably to the Surface port, so often when I thought it was charging it wasn't. A new cable resolved that problem but was an unwanted cost. Around the same time, the keyboard stopped connecting reliably as well. Sometimes it works, but frequently I have to disconnect and reconnect it, to the point where I started using a wireless mouse instead. But since it only has 1 USB port, I can't use it for anything else. In the end, I switched to a different laptop due to these limitations, but I still keep this as a backup.\n  \nRead more",

It was indistinguishable from a completely new Surface, although the packing peanuts for shipping was somewhat questionable. Regardless, for the last week the surface has been an amazing device that blends the intuitiveness of a tablet, with the full desktop experience. Some features like switching to tablet mode by folding back the keyboard (not included) were discovered by complete guess and not by research. The stand is great, and the entire product is very durable. The battery life surpassed my expectations for the power it brings, with around 6 hours at a constant of 60% memory/cpu usage. A must-buy for artists with how responsive the pen is, especially when paired with a paperlike screen protector. Works seamlessly with Clip Studio Paint. The color range is superb. GREAT. PRODUCT.

Have tried several USB devices, rebooted, used diagnostic toolkit, and updated drivers and firmware. No luck. Amazon will not honor a replacement due to me buying it from a non-Amazon seller through Amazon's platform, which is RIDICULOUSLY SCUMMY. They even 'hung up' on me in the chat function. I guess they wash their hands of all responsibility forthe products on their platform.UPDATE 8/5/24: In the interim, I contacted Amazon customer support and was misled by someone claiming a managerial role. I was told \"As your item is from the seller’s inventory, I am unable to issue a replacement.\" I contacted the seller who stated the order was fulfilled by Amazon, so they didn't have any way to assist me. I contacted Amazon customer support once again today. I asked for clarity on why I could not get a replacement for the defective unit. They refused to answer me honestly or at all, and 'hung up' on me in the chat. Currently my only option appears to be returning the unit and buying an exact replica for $150 more, now that Prime Day Sales are over. I do suspect the price difference is the reason why I was not offered a replacement.\n  \nRead more",

When I contacted Amazon customer service about it, they pointed out that under \"Other Technical Details\" towards the bottom under Product Information, the listing stated that the unit shipped with Windows 10 Home. I did not check that second section because I had assumed that the information given at the top would have already answered the question of which operating system it had.Maddeningly, Amazon's customer service hid behind that second part, stating that it was important to read the entire listing. They offered to let me return the unit for a refund and purchase a unit which came with Windows 10 Pro, but I opted to keep it and eat the cost of a Windows license upgrade, as it was ultimately the cheaper option for the hardware specs I needed.All of that aside, the Surface Pro 7 is a fantastic Windows tablet. It performs well, has a great screen and connectivity, and when combined with the optional type cover, is one of the best options out there for Windows users in need of performance and portability.\n  \nRead more",

This tablet is nowhere near as good as that... but it works well for a mobile device. I bought an aftermarket pen from Renaisser to get a better pen for it. The pen works well with Adobe and Serif products but does not work with Krita. I've had 2 months to fix Krita and could not figure it out.This tablet is good for drawing, but it gets a lot better in general once you add a type cover. If you don't get a type cover for it, you will have a bad time, because it relies on the type cover for a lot of features. The type cover also helps protect the screen.I would recommend the Pro 7 model as a good Windows 10 device, but it is a little dated. You have to be OK with some qwerks, like the pen has to go on the outside of the tablet, not in the type cover. The default pen also doesn't work well... but the Renaisser pen works quite well. Overall, it's worth the money saved to go to the older model in my opinion. That's an opinion, though, and you have to make up your own mind about that.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I purchased this product from Amazon on May 11, 2023. Initially, I was content with the purchase; however, over time, I noticed a decrease in responsiveness when using it as a notebook for writing. Given that I acquired this product primarily for my school needs, I was quite disappointed. Unfortunately, my disappointment escalated when the product suddenly malfunctioned, rendering it inoperable. Despite my attempts, I haven't been able to power it back on. Upon reviewing the return policy, I noticed that the expiration date was set for August 9, 2023, just about two weeks from now.I reached out to Amazon customer service to discuss the possibility of a return or refund. While I initially received some assurance from one of your associates, another representative later informed me that this wouldn't be possible, directing me to the original seller. Subsequently, the seller's chatbot indicated that they aren't responsible for items sold through Amazon, effectively leaving me without a recourse after the return window.This experience has been disheartening, especially coming from a reputable company like Amazon. I believe that products offered by such a well-regarded entity should demonstrate reliability and longevity, lasting beyond a short return period. This incident has left me hesitant to recommend Amazon and that specific seller to others seeking reliable products. It's my belief that a few extra dollars spent on a new device is a wiser investment than navigating these challenges.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Excellent Versatility with Minor DrawbacksThe Microsoft Surface Pro 7 is an impressive device that blends the functionality of a tablet and a laptop seamlessly. The 12.3-inch touchscreen is bright and responsive, making it great for drawing, note-taking, and multimedia use. The performance is solid, handling multitasking and productivity apps with ease.The versatility of switching between tablet and laptop mode is fantastic, especially with the optional Type Cover keyboard and Surface Pen (sold separately). The lightweight design makes it perfect for on-the-go use.However, the battery life could be better—it doesn’t last as long as I’d hoped, especially during heavy use. Additionally, the lack of ports can be limiting if you need to connect multiple devices.Overall, the Surface Pro 7 is a powerful, sleek, and versatile device that’s almost perfect for students, professionals, and creatives alike.\n  \nRead more",

Unfortunately the 1st unit had no sound hardware detected, so it was silent.  The supplier responded VERY quickly.  They offered to refund or replace, my choice.  Since I really DID want a working Surface-pro-7, I asked for a replacement.  They checked out another new unit, upgraded it to Win-11 and shipped it Fed-ex.  Of course nobody likes to have to return a defective unit, but this supplier was great and very communicative.  I would not hesitate to order from them again.  Oh, and I really love the Surface-pro.\n  \nRead more",

It doesn't get super warm but does heat up a little bit after a while. Resolution is pretty impressive. Quick charging.

                "review": "If you need a discounted, lightweight, quality laptop with a ton of nice features, GET THIS. Before you read on, know that it would be very difficult to ever change out the battery, the bottom is not screwed in because it is all one piece. It should last a long time though. Mine had absolutely no wear on it, couldn't tell it was refurbished at all. The Pixelsense screen is amazing. Note that the dimentions are 3:2, which is a little taller than most other laptops, which are 4:3 or 16:9. This may be awkward for watching movies and such, but is perfect for schoolwork. It is crazy light and thin, the alcantara keyboard is my personal favorite. It doesn't ever feel like it gets greasy. The startup time is very quick, especially with Windows Hello. My favorite feature so far is the soft-closing, so it doesnt ever slam, even when you give it a bit of pressure. The battery-life is exactly what i wanted too. You won't regret getting this if you're looking for a quality school laptop, especially at this price range.\n  \nRead more",

With the real MS keyboard/cover, this thing is even more useful. And it looks cool (not that I care but it doesn’t hurt). Battery life is 4-14 hours sIt’s not the most recent version but with high specs, it’s a powerhouse and fast and will last years. The portability and usefulness is even better than a laptop.

There are no scratches, battery life is still very good, not bulging from battery swelling. Money well spent, and it is a fantastic machine. The only issue I am having is the upgrade to Windows 11 keeps failing, but as far I can tell it's not because of faulty components. Seems a very common issue. So for that I still 5 stars.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "...this is perfect for school! My traditional laptop just bit the dust and I decided it was time to jump on the bandwagon and get a tablet laptop like my classmates. It definitely took some getting used to but I LOVE being able to insert PowerPoints into a Microsoft Notebook and write directly on them instead of keeping track of dozens of print outs. Like I said in my title, I miss my XL keyboard (with separated number keypad), but the type cover is decent enough. I have issues typing quickly in it but most of my school work is note taking anyways. Maybe next tax season I’ll break down and get a Bluetooth keyboard for home use but for now the type cover will do.  Screen size is a little small for my taste but it’s perfect for school and you can find a $30 attachment on Amazon that allows you to hook up a regular HDMI and add a secondary screen if desired. My only legitimate complaint is that everything is sold separately. I appreciate the ability to customize and choose your mouse, pen, and type cover color but all of those pieces are needed to effectively use this machine. You at least need the pen or type cover, otherwise you have to tap out notes and web searches on a weird on-screen keyboard. Just be prepared to spend more than you think, it adds up quickly!!\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "My surface pro 6 arrived and I was very excited to use it, but as soon as I started to set it up it got stuck on the windows boot screen. I did a quick google search for my problem and wrote it off as a usual update or problem that a lot of people experience, I mean the product I received looked brand new so I gave it the benefit of the doubt. After about 4 hours I finally finished setting up windows, got into windows set up my account and it worked fine for about a day. After that day I went into the settings menu to change my wallpaper and noticed that my windows were flickering and flashing blue now and then. I ended up figuring out that it only happened in windows programs and menus (i.e. OneNote was one that I planned on using a lot but couldn't due to the window flashing and resetting every 30 seconds). I wrote it off as a regular issue and just restarted it, after restarting it the problem persisted and crashed the PC a couple of times with a blue screen of death. After running diagnostics on why the computer crashed I tried updating to the most recent version of windows. Found out that didn't help either and it kept crashing. Ran diagnostics again, did some research, and found out that it was coming down to a hardware issue. I tried resetting to a clean version of windows, but that did not help either and the menus in the setup started flashing too. I gave up and made a return request and plan on re-purchasing after receiving my refund since they couldn't do a replacement. I'll change this review if my newer one works fine, but as of now, this is my experience.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Got this to do schoolwork while travelling. The type-cover is separate, but this is fine because you may want to use a standalone mechanical keyboard, use an aftermarket option, or the on screen keyboard if you will primarily use as a tablet.The i5 processor and 8gb of ram was enough for me to use design software, play some older video games, and edit short videos.The 128gb storage is enough for the OS and about 90gb for apps and photos, but you can add a micro SD for additional storage in the back! Iove this because then I can swap SD cards easily and it kept cost down vs the 256gb option.I draw on the touchscreen and the experience us flawless. The rennaisser pen is my choice, but sure the surface pen is great too.Overall, an excellent device and good value. Bought renewed from Ctech ii through Amazon. Great service and good condition used device.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Had bought a refurbished Surface Pro 4 off of Amazon a couple of years ago that was like new and is still going strong for use as my office video streamer and as my beater travel laptop. Bought this “refurbished” Surface Pro 6 as a gift for a family member who is mainly going to use it for surfing the internet, streaming video, email, and light (very light/retro) gaming.What was in the box:-Surface Pro 6 Tablet-Surface Pro 6 charging cablePurchased separately:-Refurbished Microsoft FMM-00001 Type Cover for Surface ProPros:-8th generation Intel processor - oldest Surface Pro model that can be updated to run Windows 11 (at least officially – have Windows 11 on my Surface Pro 4, but had to jump through some hoops to get it to install since 11 is not officially supported on the 4)-8GB ram when some models in the older generations of Surface Pros only had 4GB. Windows 10 and 11 will run with only 4, but both run better with 8 or more.-256 GB SSD – larger storage always better, but IMO 256 GB is the current minimum that I feel comfortable with on a newer PC. Anything less seems to fill quicker than you expect.-MicroSD card slot – again, more storage always better and this allows you to expand it a bit if needed. Threw an old 128GB card I had into it. Latest 2 versions of the Surface Pro (8 & 9) no longer have a microSD card slot.-Has 1 USB 3.0 type A port– 2 would have been nicer and I get the advantages that the USB-C ports on the newer Surface Pros have, but at least one older USB A port is nice to have for use with legacy USB equipment (mouse, game controller, flash drives).-No fans. Had read a review on here that stated that the i5 version didn’t have fans where as the i7 version did. Didn’t believe it until it arrived. Could be a negative for others if you want to try and push this system to run anything taxing as lack of fans could cause throttling if it starts to overheat, but no fans a plus for purposes for which this one will be used.Cons:-Sold as refurbished in Excellent condition. IMO opinion, should have been rated Very Good vs Excellent. Screen was like new, but corners and kickstand have several scuff marks- like it was dropped at least a couple of times. Since it’s the black model, was able to cover scuffs with a black permanent marker.-8th generation Intel cpu now 5 generations behind, so not the latest, greatest.-Surface Pro 6 now 3 generations behind latest Surface Pro versions, so support and updating device specific drivers no longer a priority for Microsoft-Next to impossible for the average person to update or replace anything in the Surface Pros as doing so requires prying off the screen and likely breaking it vs some other laptops that make it easy to replace or upgrade at least the ram and harddrives/SSDs. Can now easily replace SSDs on the newer Surface Pro models (7+ (not the 7), 8, and 9), but not on models that came before them like this 6. Once battery dies, likely means having to replace the entire system.Neutral-Battery came with no charge. Tried charging for 30 minutes before booting first time and still at 0%. Fortunately, would boot when plugged in. Known issue with some Surface Pro models was that one of Microsoft’s driver updates caused those models to stop charging. Downloaded and installed latest drivers for the Surface Pro 6 and it started charging and charged to 100% in about an hour and a half.-Took about 2 hours to set up and then download and update from Windows 10 to 11. An annoyance you have with all “new” Windows PCs.Summary:Happy with the purchase as is the family member it was gifted to. While not the latest version, it’s still perfectly useful for everyday tasks. The build quality of the Surface Pro is in a class of their own as far as Windows devices go. Hope to get a good 3 years of use out of it.\n  \nRead more",

All ports are clean (no debris or markings around them). Battery capacity appears to be stock or very near stock. All fans sounds even and operational.  The screen attachment mechanism is in perfect shape (I have been using the 13\" version for quite awhile, this one is just a sturdy if not even better).One problem though: Came with W10 Pro installed, but the product key used was for W10 Home.

                "review": "I love this Surface Pro 7. I invested in this to use for school and take notes in the office apps for classes and this is just a dream to use. Given you need to buy the type cover and the surface pen, it's a great purchase overall. Small and sleek to hide in your backpack, a lightweight item that wont bog you down, with all the power of windows 10. It comes with windows 10 pro preloaded, and a great screen. Taking notes on this \"tablet\" is milky smooth with the surface pen, it detects pressure and makes thicker strokes in OneNote, its like buttery smooth and works like a charm. Its palm rejection is okay, sometimes my hand presses another section of my notes which throws me off sometimes but it happens rarely. Given its refurbished, the battery life isn't the best compared to when you buy a new one, but it gets me through the day and handles all my tasks for the day, from emails to note taking to just simple video consumption, this laptop does it all. Plus it's a steal for the price and you save a few hundred as it still has a powerful processor and can handle heavy tasks or many open apps at once. You can always get a bluetooth keyboard and get the pen if you need it for handwriting notes or just to draw. It does it all. I give this product a glowing recommendation and think its a great purchase for the price point, compared to buying it new, even though buying it new comes with the type cover. At least you can customize it in your way. Hope this helped your buying process!\n  \nRead more",

When I attempted to contact Amazon about a replacement power supply, the only resolution was to return everything.  This would be fine if we hadn't already spent hours loading software and configuring the device.  How embarrassing, as a business, to hand a new employee a \"brand new\" defective piece of equipment.  Then find out the only solution is to take that equipment leaving them with nothing for \"a week to 10 days\" to process this?  AMAZON, DO BETTER FOR BUSINESSES!\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "OK, I'll admit: I was extremely skeptical when buying this \"renewed\" laptop. I can't tell you how many times I've bought a \"refurbished\" device only to receive something that looked and performed like it had been to war. Echoing what others have said, this is the exact opposite. My laptop came well-packaged and it comes in Microsoft Certified Refurbished white box. It was even packaged like it was brand new with the plastic wrap on the device and accessories (which were also new). Furthermore, there were no signs of wear or use on the laptop. It looks like a brand new device. I checked the battery health (both with Windows and Linux) and both report the battery at 100% health. In fact, Windows had the cycle count at 2.For the laptop itself, I'm very impressed with the Surface Laptop Go. I was coming from a Chuwi laptop, which was good in its own right, but I can't believe how premium this laptop is. It's fast, well-built and handles anything I need to do on it. Admittedly, I was worried about the display resolution, but after using the device, I can say it was unfounded. The display on this thing is fantastic. Where it falls short on the resolution numbers, it makes up by being a fantastic panel. The keyboard and trackpad are great. I understand that people miss the backlit keyboard, but that's a non-issue for me. I usually turn that feature off to save on battery. The sound quality is also great. It's loud with good clarity. I can't speak on the battery life, yet, but it seems average so far. Being a Microsoft device, Windows 11 is a pleasant experience. However, if you're a Linux fan (like me), you'll be happy to know that everything works out of the box.Overall, I am extremely pleased. The condition, value and performance of the laptop are all fantastic. I can't speak of the longevity of the laptop, but everything seems great so far. Sure, there are better value options out there (Chuwi, Alldocube, etc.) in this price segment, but I worried about the quality control with those devices. I would definitely purchase this again.\n  \nRead more",

No Windows laptop can match that Apple package. But you don't like MacOS.You want a Windows machine.Something small and light. iPad ish, but a laptop, where you can do PLENTY.Something with a decent CPU to do the occasional video editing.Comfortably game on online services like Stadia. Type on the best keyboard you've ever typed on(yes the backlit is missing but I'm not complaining at this price point).Good battery life.Decent screen( yes the MacBook air is nicer, but price point).Look no further. THIS IS THE ONE. I got it renewed. Everything looked new, but the trackpad wasn't working correctly. Sent it to Microsoft. Repaired and back in a week. Works flawlessly. My wife now leaves her MacBook Air with M1 on her desk and hogs my machine because she finds it more portable and 'cute'.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "It's small and cute.  Nice ice blue color (rather than plain silver).  Display isn't bad even if it isn't full 1080P.  Battery life >> guess it's ok since you can't fit big batteries in this small footprint.  Computing power is adequate for business use (MS Office) but not photoshop stuff.  I will use my ipads for that.So I haven't used windows PC for about 6, 7 years since I quit my company office job and didn't need Microsoft Office or any business apps.  Was using ipads for most of my web activities, which is pretty good.However, I have once again started some jobs that require office apps and decided on this \"renewed\" Surface Laptop Go (I first purchased Surface Go 3, but it didn't quite stand up to my needs for office use).First of all, \"renewed\" isn't like what you see on ebay or craigslist.  It's professionally packaged, just like Apple refurbished products that you purchase directly from Apple.  Mine had almost 10months warranty remaining.  Battery capacity was 100%.  It's just great value to go for renewed.  The price also has dropped considerably now.  I think you can get if for less than $500.It's a great value.  Again, if you just need basic computing needs, don't do any graphics intense stuff like video editing or games (although it does some games quite well), and don't mind the small screen, and need to take your laptop with you at all times, this is perfect.By the way, when I work at home, I do have an external display.  I purchased a 24\" monitor for about $150.  With dual monitor set-up, it really boosts your productivity.  All this for less than $800.  Super happy that I purchased this.So, just crossing my fingers that there won't be any issues with it in the long run.\n  \nRead more",

Also after reading review on it, I noticed that it’s probably just a problem with the computer in general not just mine .It crashes while I’m on a Team call, it crashed while I’m doing an exam… like literally every time.I’m now stuck with a crashing computer, as the deadline for a return has exceeded 😢Pros:The computer is light, gorgeous and fits perfectly in your purse or back.

I then upgraded with Windows 11 pro as directed..i did noticed however of the large size on disc of windows 11..(approx 64 gb) so in retrospect..would have picked the unit with 256gb of memory first..Battery is not as efficient as claimed..am lucky if i can get 4hrs out of it....but its fast to recharge...overall, i bought this bcoz of the small size of this unit which makes it ideal to travel..\n  \nRead more",

I would not pay the brand new price! Buy refurbished instead and then it’s worth it for a small laptop to do school work on.

It is loaded with so many features and has an excellent large screen for viewing along with all the MS programs you ecpect. Personally I was shopping for a sheet music display for PDF files and the Surface Pro is one of the top 3 reccomemdations when I researched this need. I suppose the biggest advantage was the price for this tablet. Unless you insist on an iPAD or Samsung tablet you should be very satisfied with this Surface Pro 4. It responds perfectly and looks beautiful. I also purchased a stylus and that helps so much for editing PDFs as you can \"pinpoint\" when editing. The touch screen does work perfectly with my finger but again the stylus is great for intricate and accurate touch. I am very pleased with this purchase!\n  \nRead more",

It handles Windows 10 smoothly and is pretty quick.  It is not Windows 11 capable per Microsoft, however it is possible to load Windows 11 on the tablet and I read it works as well as Windows 10 and maybe a bit fast.

                "review": "EDIT:After 2 weeks of use in a college environment I have found the Surface 3 to be quite capable. It hasn't been problem free however. Having never owned a tablet this was a new experience for me.My connection to the college wireless has been spotty, whereas the connection on my Nexus 5x with the college wireless has been pretty spot on. I get better connections inside with the Surface 3 while in the lecture halls, but it may require multiple refreshes. The college requires mac address registration for all devices accessing its wireless. There is no mac address on a label on the outside of the Surface 3 so you have to go into the console commands and do an ipconfig query and look at the 'physical address'.The preloaded app called Drawboard PDF is a horrible program. It works great for 15 or so minutes and then your finger/pen strokes start to display slower and slower and slower until you are waiting for minutes for something you drew to show up. Eventually the app crashes. I attempted to get customer support and received an automated reply a week ago promising a follow up. I am still waiting. Of course I discovered that OneNote does everything Drawboard PDF does plus a hundred more things... and OneNote doesn't have the slow down problem at all.I have since purchased a Microsoft Surface Pen for Surface Pro 4, and a used Microsoft Surface 3 Type Cover to complete the ensemble. The Pen is amazing, the keyboard is a little too floppy for lap use because in a lecture hall you rarely get a desk to place your laptop on. My solution to the floppy keyboard problem was to get a Leather Folio Cover which offers more rigidityOverall, I have now spent much more money than I had originally intended. I spent $550 in total, not including tax. I used Prime for all parts, so no shipping costs. For $550 there are several faster laptops with more storage I could have purchased but wouldn't have gotten the modularity or touch/pen capabilities. So, I'm finding myself adapt to this different paradigm instead of it adapting to me.ORIGINAL REVIEW:After reading some of the 1 star reviews here I was worried. I made sure to select a unit in the list that specified new condition.So far so good. I've unboxed it and found the unit to be brand new with the exception that it had a refurbished sticker added to the back of the unit and included a newsprint booklet saying it was a refurb. The packaging was flawless. I plugged it into power and turned it on and was greeted by the first user experience and intro for Windows 10. This took a few minutes because I turned off some options for privacy and setup wireless. It had a 20% charge on the battery. There were about a dozen updates that needed to be done. Using the Drawboard PDF app, pre-installed, without a pen went quite well as this was the type of application I had in mind for taking notes during lectures.At this point in time I am quite pleased with it. The unit is in perfect condition without any blemishes.I will update this review only if I find something wrong.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "False advertising for this product.  The ad clearly says it has a ONE YEAR manufacturers warranty from Microsoft.  That is 100% FALSE in my case.  My item arrived and did not work..the dreaded BATTERY PLUGGED in but not charging problem that seems to be common with the Surface products.  I went to every forum, went to every video on how to fix this problem no luck. Called Microsoft for support and low and behold the warranty on this product had expired almost 6 months ago in June  2017.  So NO WARRANTY as promised.  Microsoft offered to renew the warranty at $29.00 a month or around $150 a year..yikes almost as much as the unit cost....So here I sit with a worthless piece of junk I have am going to have to send back, refurbished means they must have cleaned the unit with a cloth and put it in a box. Obviously nobody checked it, the battery would never charge beyond 50% when totally off..(never will charge plugged in) so that tells me it's the old original battery and is on it's way out..again refurbished why didn't they try charging the battery?  Why didn't someone plug this in and see if the battery actually charged before they sold it.BEWARE.. do NOT, do NOT buy these refurbished products..spend a bit more money and get a NEW ONE.....this is a joke, a travesty and a blatant lie on their ad. I would NEVER have bought this if it didn't say it came with  a one year warranty....and that turned out to be 100% BS....Very disappointed --Note today is 11/5/2017.  Microsoft pulled up this page for with the photo attached for  me showing this device has an expired warranty and that it expired june 3 2017.  Very sad that they are allowed to get away with peddling this type of nonsense.Microsoft Surface 3 Tablet (10.8-Inch, 64 GB, Intel Atom, Windows 10) (Certified Refurbished)\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Where do I begin to talk about the Microsoft Surface 3?I had originally bought the Surface 3 more as a novelty if anything. I use an 8\" Samsung Tab for work, and fiddling around with it had always tempted me to go out and buy my own. I've always been a fan of Microsoft products (I use Windows for both my laptop as well as phone) so I wanted to complete my own little ecosystem. I had only intended to have the Surface 3 as a tablet for browsing the web and reading articles from the comfort of my living room couch.Well.. that was my original intention... Fast forward to a month and a half later, and I'm using the Surface 3 daily. I use it for all my office needs - creating powerpoints for my lectures, and writing reports up as well. When it comes to meetings, I flip the keyboard under and pull out my Surface Pen to handwrite notes on Nebo.

                "review": "I love this little thing! It's not super small, but it's not very big either. I use it without the keyboard a lot as a reading tablet with the Kindle PC application and I love it! I have a matte screen protector so it looks and feels more like paper and doesn't cling onto finger prints. My only issue with it is that it's kind of slow and lags when opening applications and browsers and the face recognition feature tends to not be able to recognize my face when I first power it on. Not a huge deal, but can be kind of irritating. I have ADHD so I get frustrated when computers lag or take a long time to load because I'm in hyperfocus mode and trying to get something done before I forget or lose interest. Luckily I don't have that issue very often, but it does happen. Also, I can use my Silhouette software on it like a normal laptop so that's a huge plus for me. It connects and works like a charm majority of the time which was a huge thing I was looking for when looking for a new laptop. Overall, I really like it and I'd recommend it. If you're looking for something to use as a tablet but also needs PC abilities for certain applications, I'd go with this or the Surface Pro if it's within your budget. If you're looking for a tablet to use for artistry and just general web browsing, I'd say the iPad Pros are a better choice for that field as they are more tailored to those capabilities. I will also add that I have a generic brand keyboard, Bluetooth mouse, and USB/HDMI adapter that all work really well with no issues with this device.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I’ll start with, the item came a day sooner than originally scheduled, so that was nice. I want to love it, the size is great, weight is great, and it’s running smooth…..right now, literally just got it. However, drum roll please, I am not pleased completely with the condition of the device. I purchased an excellent condition renewed device and I got more of a good condition device which is listed at about $20 less. I went with excellent for this particular item because I wanted to avoid the chance of screen scratches. I’ve ordered refurb from Amazon before and it’s been great, actually I ordered a good condition paper white and it came in excellent condition. Leading me to try it again….but it seems like the opposite happened this time. The back is really scratched up, you can tell the device got a lot of use, fine, that can be covered with a case (I’m not that picky). But the scratches are bugging me out. Per Amazon Cosmetic Conditions of an Excellent Condition Renewed device you shouldn’t be able to see damage at 12in away. I took a couple pics at 12in away and you can see the scratches. Not only that you can feel them. I’m just worried they may get bigger with time and start causing issues. I’m up for a resolution. I guess I’ll get in contact with the buyer. I dislike leaving bad reviews but it’s helpful to leave accurate reviews so customers know what to expect. Will update review later….hope I’m backed up by that 90-day Amazon guarantee….til then… hope this helps you make your decision because it took me a minute to make mine.Update: I reached out to Amazon and I’ll be receiving a replacement…..keep you posted.\n  \nRead more",
