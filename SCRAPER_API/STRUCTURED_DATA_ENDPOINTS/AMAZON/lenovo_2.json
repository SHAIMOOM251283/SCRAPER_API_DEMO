It did appear to be an upgraded Windows 7 computer in the BIOS. Windows was only removed as this was purchased for work where I do \"geek\" computer things that Linux is easier to use.If you are looking for a solid laptop to use for Linux this machine is a solid choice. You will need to go into Windows and change a few settings to do the conversion to whatever Linux Distribution you decide to go with.Pro: It's a very sleek, slim, and fast computer for the price point. It has a ethernet connection point unlike most laptops anymore.Con: I am not a fan of the powercharger that was included and have it currently running off a docking station.Overall I will probably grab another one of these laptops for personal usage.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I have been in technology for almost 50 years. in my lifetime I have used just about everything that computes, calls, calculates, shows time, and locates. I have used it, sold it, broke it, and repaired it, from mainframe computers to watches.I needed a new laptop, my old one was 10 years old but still able to run Windows 11. It's tiny and kind of slow, so I searched Amazon exhaustively for a new one and came across this, the 40GB RAM Ryzen 7 Lenovo.I've always been an HP fan but have used Lenovos before, they are always well built and last a long time. This one is probably the best I have seen. I'm not a PC gamer, so I don't need intense graphical speed, but I think the Radeon GPU can handle anything I need to throw at it, and the OS loads in less than 10 seconds. It's light, has a 1TB SSD which is enough room for me, and did I say fast? The RAM can load the whole OS.The keyboard is excellent, I don't need a backlit one, it has every key imaginable, even a side numeric keypad.It's light, VERY light weight, and the perfect form factor for me at 14\". Best design ever.If you don't need a powerhouse for gaming, want to browse the Internet , do your taxes, watch videos, and maybe create a video once in a while, this laptop can do it all. People complain about the viewing angle and video, but I downloaded the latest drivers from AMD and I don't see a problem. It was shipped quickly even to my remote rural community, great seller. Two days.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "This laptop was not for me.  The computer looked fine but when I opened it, all the text was too small for me to read before setting everything up.  I know the font could be enlarged after setup. The computer did not have a touch screen which I use on my current computer because my hand is too shaky to use the touchpad. To set it up, I had to use the touchpad and read the small text.  I am 80 years old, had to use a magnifying glass to even see the curser so after spending about 2 hours trying to get it set up, I decided it was not the machine for me.  I contacted Amazon and got return instructions, stating my reasons for not keeping it. I reset the machine and packaged it up and returned through UPS Store.It probably would be good for someone who is younger and more computer literate.  It did have school mode and game mode shown as user selections.  Nice looking machine, way lighter than my current one which I need to replace to use Windows 11.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Overall this is a decent, value oriented basic laptop. It will perform most of the stuff a student needs with a very simple version of MS Office. But at this price, please realize that it isn't built for games. (That may be a good thing if you want your kid to get their assignments finished on time ;0) To save some ca$h, I bought the \"Used - Like New\" version. The laptop I received probably had an older “generic image” of software reloaded for resale. As such, it required a couple years’ worth of Windows 11 updates, which can be frustrating. After a few failed attempts including one infamous Microsoft BSOD, I finally got the thing running reliably stable. But that took quite some time researching and downloading additional \"update repair\" software readily available at Microsoft’s websites after following advice from user forums. In my experience this is not unusual with MS. Their products have to work on many different brands of machines, which is not an easy thing to achieve. If you want a sturdy metal frame “good to go right out of the box” machine, buy a refurbed, slightly older Apple laptop for a little bit more. I’ve had several of those too. Apple has tight controls on both their hardware and software products. They work well and last a long time… As they say, “You pay for what you get!”\n  \nRead more",

Yeah the old adage \"you get what you pay for\" applies here. Massively.It is SO slow. May as well have 1g of ram. No setting optimization fixes this. NOTHING works properly. Everything is so buggy and crashes often. I bought this to run quickbooks for a business and my 85 year old book keeper was making fun of me for how slow it was and how I shouldn't have cheaped out and bought this POS.Yeah imagine an 80+ yr old man complaining about how slow a \"new\" computer is. It's that bad and worse.The screen is literally the worst screen I've ever seen in real life. Laptops 10+ years older have a screen that blows this away. It actually hurts my eyes after about 30 minutes and that's never happened to me before. It is so hard to look at.The whole thing is SUPER cheap. The keyboard layout is stupid and if you're used to a normal keyboard get ready to hit the wrong keys constantly.There is no redeeming quality to this laptop. It's absolutely garbage DO NOT BUY. It's probably not even worth the aggravation trying to get everything off of it and return, so the best I can hope for is some good karma put out in the universe saving some other poor souls the misfortune of buying this POS.Do not buy. You're welcome.\n  \nRead more",

Gen 12 X1 Carbon updates include Intel’s 14th-gen Meteor Lake Core Ultra processors bringing improved graphics performance, stronger multi-core performance, AI capabilities, and greater power efficiency without sacrificing performance.",

            "Manufactured with recycled carbon fiber, the X1 Carbon Gen 12 incorporates recycled materials from front to back. The top, bottom, keyboard, and even the battery back all include recycled materials. Bio-based materials like bamboo and sugarcane are integrated into the laptop packaging, ensuring it is 100% rapidly renewable.",
            "The updated keyboard includes tactile bumps on some of the keys, making it easier for touch typists. The revised 120mm glass touchpad is larger than the last one (110mm) and still includes the familiar ThinkPad buttons at the top. Other changes include a slightly smaller form factor, thinner bezels providing a 5% higher screen-to-body ratio and it’s even lighter, just 2.41 pounds without the charger!",

With a range of ports, including two USB-C/Thunderbolt 4, two USB-A 3.2, and HDMI ports, connect multiple peripherals as well as experience faster downloads and quick file transfers. Minimal preloaded applications mean maximum battery life and responsiveness for users, and faster deployment for IT admins."

By purchasing this, I saved several hundred dollars and couldn’t be happier. Is a great size and designed like a windows laptop so ease of use is intuitive and connects like any other device. Runs as it should and time will tell how durable it is but so far I’m very happy. Of note though, the functionality is different than windows and does take some getting used to. A web search will help in that regard and will tell you the limitations of a Chromebook vs laptop and help you decide if this can be a viable option for your needs. Honestly love that it’s blue and not black - not a consideration but helps delineate between my work laptop and my personal Chromebook without difficulty from across the room.\n  \nRead more",

I've owned Samsungs, Pixels, Fire tablets, and everything in between over multiple hardware generations. They all left me wanting.So much so that I had started courting the devil himself and was considering an iPad. Then, like mana from the heavens, this device appeared on my radar. It even has acceptable specs. It also has some decent speakers.I don't care about the speakers. What I care about in a tablet is flexibility and reliability. Well, it doesn't get much more flexible than Android and after several months of use, I'm happy to say that reliability isn't an issue either.If you are looking for a tablet that isn't iOS, take the plunge on this Android machine.\n  \nRead more",

The screen is crisp and clear though I do wish it got a little brighter at max. The speakers are, as expected,  very loud but they are also very good sounding. Probably the best I've ever heard of any portable device that isn't a dedicated speaker. As for performance i only use this tablet for stuff like YouTube and Pandora which it runs smoothly. I don't know how well it'll do for stuff that needs more power but it feels like a snappy and overall smooth machine. The device itself feels very premium both in materials and build quality. The built in stand is also a great thing to have. I don't care for the included sleeve case since it can't be used while the tablet is inside it which to me defeats the purpose of a folio case.  Either way I highly recommend this if you need a medium duty media machine\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Bought this primarily as a backup to my 3 year old iPad Pro. The Lenovo while Android based, gives you a lot for not much. The speaker system is about the best I've heard from any tablet, even better than my iPad which cost 3 times the price, loud and clear. This built in flip out stand is sturdy and makes it ideal for laying on your night stand to watch late night movies or streaming TV at your bedside. Cameras are pretty good for a tablet and perfect for video calls, Zoom, etc but don't expect DSLR quality.The display is also pretty bright and crisp. The battery lasts for hours playing Netflix and YouTube, and the processor is stout enough there isn't any lag or sluggishness noted. Lenovo includes a slip case AND 45 watt USB-C power brick and cable, two things you'll never get from Apple or Samsung. It actually has a HEADPHONE JACK, so you can plug in headphones, use it as a line out source, and if you use the FM radio tuner feature (yep, the tablet even has an FM tuner), you'll need to plug in headphones to use as an FM antenna (you can play the radio through the speakers but the headphones must be connected). The micro SD card slot supports data storage but you can't offload apps to the card.The out of box experience is simple. You can copy data from another tablet, phone (iOS or Android). The only irritant is Lenovo stuffing junkware/shovelware like stupid games and TikTok, but they can (and were) deleted. Other than that, it works well and price is low considering the build quality and specs. Lenovo says they will provide 4 years of updates. Mine came with Android 14 out of the box.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Since I have been quite of bit of hands-on data as well as report production and design work for the last few months, I recently tried several options for a portable monitor to use with my 14 Inch MacBook Pro. My requirements when I started were: light weight, single USB C/Thunderbolt (eg no separate power needed), and for it to be approximately the same size as the MacBook at least height-wise.With my first purchase (and return) I quickly found out that despite the many options all touting the same specs, I had to add a few requirements. Shape (needed it to be 14 wide), built-in ability to stand on its own vs a floppy cover solution, and most importantly, reasonably accurate color.  Also, pass-through power is a very nice-to-have so that there's only one USB C Thunderbolt cable connected to the Mac and power can connect to the monitor and pass back through to the Mac through the one Thunderbolt cable.This monitor met all the requirements above. The color is -very- accurate. A side-by-side comparison to the other portables was instantly clear. No need to run through lots of tests (although I did try extensively to adjust them. The ThinkVision worked perfectly out of the box.Another really nice feature is the way they implemented the \"kickstand\".  It's not really a kickstand but more of a fold-out base. The connections are built in to that which offset them from the edge of the screen unlike all the others, which means you can stand it up right against the Mac even with cables plugged into both sides.I -thought- I was going to have to trade off weight when comparing choices, but I am certain this is the same and possibly lighter than the Arzopa, my second choice.  I don't have a precise scale to verify this.  However I did a blind \"place one in my hand\" test and picked the lighter as the ThinkVision. If I can get my hands on a scale while I still have these I will update. Be aware that the specs claim the others are all lighter than the ThinkVision, which again I doubt.  In any case, it is negligible either way.Lastly, as a nice feature, it comes with a felt sleeve.  This is perfect for my bike bag and backpack to protect against scratches or worse.The one trade-off that is real is the price. This is approximately 90ish dollars more than several other appealing-looking options currently.  Make no mistake, this monitor is worth that and more if you are planning to use it often at all. Personally I will always pay for true quality if a piece of equipment is clearly better than the rest. If you are a Mac user you probably feel the same. This monitor is a worthy companion for a road warrior, anyone who moves their work spot often, or just wants to keep their work space flexible.\n  \nRead more",

I love the fold out stand on the back. I have purchased 2 other laptop monitors for my staff and they use magnetically attached covers which have proved to be a real pain. This set up is much better for me.The resolution is colors are great. I can match the color of my MacBook for consistency across both monitors. I do graphic design and it works well for that. I can work anywhere on the road simply by pulling the computer and monitor out of the backpack and I am at work.It's rugged and I highly recommend it.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I bought both a Lenovo M14 and M14t (with touch).The M14 is a great portable monitor. I have several generic portable monitors for various uses but found the folding cover/stand most of them have to be hard to use. They’d often fall over.The stand on the M14 is great. It allows for tilt and limited height adjustment to match your laptop display. The monitor is pretty light, so I do wonder if wind will be an issue trying to use this outdoors.Image quality seems to match my HD IPS Thinkpad displays.This monitor only connects via DisplayPort over USB-C.  Make sure your laptop supports this - not all USB-C ports do.  Also, you can pass power through the monitor, especially useful if all your USB-C ports are in use. It does reduce the power sent to the laptop. My Lenovo 65w USB-C charger shows as a 45w adaptor when connected through one of these monitors. Using a Dell 90w USB-C charger increases the power to 60 watts to the laptop.The monitor supports VESA mounting via screw holes on the bottom of the stand. Clips are included to lock the stand in place when mounted.The case is the only let down. It is a soft felt sleeve, which is nice enough, but doesn’t seem to offer any impact protection to the front of the screen. I bought a rigid laptop bag designed for a 16” MacBook Pro and it comfortably holds both displays in their sleeves and I’m much more comfortable transporting the displays.\n  \nRead more",

Somehow after working virtually, being \"stuck\" with only the laptop screen on trips has been a bit of a headache and does not seem to work anymore - one still has to manage multiple documents while writing or editing plus handle meetings on Zoom or Teams. This screen has come with me to Africa and so far is holding up well. It is light and thin, resting between my two laptops in my shoulder bag. The felt carrying sleeve is nice, shielding it from dings / scratches as it goes into the trays for x-ray checks at all the various airports. It connects easily with the USB-C (my laptop has the latest USB-C but not a Thunderbolt cxn) and works as any other second screen to clone or extend my desktop. As many reviews have noted, it is a bright, colorful screen. It works quite well with my Dell Latitude 7490. My giraffe-in-Masai-Mara background is just as bright on the M14 as on the Dell, and with colors matching between the screens. The frame puts the screen even at the same height as my laptop. The stand holds the screen firmly in position but adjusts as needed.All in all, this is a screen that I would recommend.\n  \nRead more",

Like most IPS panels, the contrast ratio is just okay. Viewing angles are good. Brightness is acceptable, but glare can be an issue in some conditions, e.g. a window behind you during daylight.My 2021 Macbook Pro defaulted to driving this monitor at 960x540, but the image is perfectly sharp when \"scaled\" to its true native resolution of 1920x1080 -- though, with the Mac, that means UI text is quite small.  However, if you're more than about 50cm away from the screen, the lower resolution may be preferable.I would prefer a somewhat higher pixel density, but at 14\" the FHD resolution is an acceptable 157 PPI -- about 70% of what would be considered \"HiDPI\".I would also prefer a 16:10 aspect ratio over 16:9. I think 16:9 is an odd choice here, since this monitor is clearly intended for productivity rather than media consumption -- and most of Lenovo's own productivity-oriented ThinkPad laptops use 16:10 as well.\n  \nRead more",

When it arrived I tried to turn on the backlight but nothing worked yet I still believed what the review had said. So I tried for HOURS to get it to work. Impossible, of course. In the process I also discovered that the computer was extremely slow and updating it bogged down, took hours and then didn't fully update. I searched for info on how to turn on the backlight back when I still believed there was one and ended up on a site that locked my computer and insisted I not try to turn it off because that could result in identity theft and they gave a phone number to call. Oh sure. I'd never call. It was all a scam and I don't know why my Malwarebytes didn't block that site. Anyway, that did it. I packaged it up and sent it back to Amazon despite my personal info on the computer that I couldn't remove because of the scam site locking the computer. Horrible experience. Went to a local store, bought another model Dell, one with a backlight,, and it's working great. I hope Amazon refunds me for the one that became a brick.\n  \nRead more",

I was hesitant about non-intel but this Ryzen 7 is. as they say in commercials, \"blazing fast\", - the unit is upgraded by GreatPriceTech to have the RAM I wanted and they added a USB hub so that the laptop only having two built in USB ports is not an issue. Shipping was prompt, unit arrived in excellent condition. Warranty is directly with the dealer and not Lenovo but so far no issues so hopefully don't have to test that although my experience with factory warranty help is that hopefully it can't be worse.\n  \nRead more",

But as a photographer and sometimes video editor, I couldn't help but be amazed by the ingenuity of the Apple ecosystem.Then I took a trip to the Apple store and trust me when I tell you that Apple is already thinking far into the future. I've purchased PCs and Laptops from Best Buy and the service is severely lacking. But at the Apple store you're treated like royalty. There are instructors there to give classes. You can set an appointment to try out futuristic new gear. The store is designed for your comfort and education.It was the trip to the Apple store that sold me. And now I really enjoy the connectivity of my Apple products. I can take a picture on my phone, write notes on my iPad, and edit them all together in the PC with little to no latency.I bought a refurbished 14\" M4 Pro, and I can not tell that it wasn't new. The packaging and presentation looked like it came straight from the factory. I've had no issues with the macbook and I've been traveling with it for a couple of months now.The 14\" is perfect for me because I travel a lot, and when I'm working from home I have the Asus Pro Art monitor to edit on. It feels like the perfect combination to me.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "This is my very first Apple device, my initial thoughts are:I am very impressed by the hardware of this device. Specifically:- A quick CPU benchmark placed this at around 90% of my desktops performance (Ryzen 9 9800X3D). For a laptop, that is absolutely unheard of.- The battery seems to last forever, even with semi-intensive workloads. At one point I used it for an hour and still had 97% battery.- The display is incredible. The contrast, resolution, and refresh rate combined make this about the best I've seen.- The webcam is high quality.- The MagSafe charger is very niceIn general, Macs don't support as much software as Windows. In my case, it does support everything I would need a laptop for, but it is something to keep in mind.However, because Apple has their own OS, hardware, etc, the software experience is far more tailored to the device than Windows devices are. As an example, the webcam settings are very easy to use and access.The device itself is very light and thin, it was a little smaller than I expected, ordering the 14 inch one, but I don't have any issues with it.In conclusion: This is a premium laptop, for a premium price - designed with ease of use and workloads in mind.\n  \nRead more",

But then, the MacBook quit charging. I tried changing outlets, turning the MacBook off and on. I finally was able to charge the MacBook using a USB-C cord. This morning, I finally looked into the receptor port for the magnetic thingie. There was something the size of a salt crystal, moveable with my fingernail, but I couldn't remove it. Heavy sigh, I remembered suggestions found online re solving charging problems and I blew out with compressed air, both ends of the charging cable.Viola, the magnet ends clamped together and a little green light came on showing the ends were connected properly. And, yes, the MacBook Air was charging properly.I'd only owned it for 4 days, used it inside the house and discarded the idea that magnetic dirt could have possibly gotten  anywhere on anything. Yes, it can...The DVD/CD player i'd gotten with the MacBook works great once you find out how to put the eject button on the top bar of the screen and to figure out what the eject image looks like.I'm 75. That's how intuitive the Apple MacBook is. Yes, I need to look up things. I'm looking forward to cataloging my pictures and editing them on my MacBook Air.\n  \nRead more",

AirDrop, iMessage, Handoff, and Universal Clipboard all work effortlessly, creating a smooth and connected workflow I didn’t know I was missing.If you're looking for a fast, reliable, and ultra-portable laptop for everyday use, the MacBook Air M4 is a no-brainer.

As someone who uses it for basic work and schooling this is exactly what i was looking for. I chose the 24g ram + ssd upgrade just so future proof it a bit, but if you are just doing normal work you should be just fine with the 16g version.Pro's:- Lightweight- Super long lasting battery- Fast multitasking function- Sleek beautiful design, Especially in the Midnight color- No Fan's so no NoiseCon's:- The midnight color does leave fingerprints behind, but not an issue if you wipe it away once in a while.- upgrades are extremely pricey- if coming from PC there is learning curve, but once learned its very nice to use.- no fans, so Heavy tasks that cause heat could cause it to throttle.Overall the price for value for this product is really good, I'd recommend it to anyone if its within your budget.\n  \nRead more",

I’ve been using it for work, browsing, video calls, and even some light photo editing, and it handles everything smoothly.The larger screen is great for multitasking, especially if you’re used to working with split windows or multiple apps side by side. It’s still really thin and light, so it’s easy to carry around, and the sky blue color looks even better in person.Battery life has also been solid. I’ve been getting through full days without needing to charge, even with pretty heavy use. And it runs totally silent.Overall, it’s been a great upgrade.

                "review": "I’ve been using the 15” MacBook Air M4 for about 1.5 months. Despite its fanless design, it stays remarkably cool during long sessions. The M4 chip is incredibly fast, handling multitasking, creative apps, and more effortlessly.The 15” Liquid Retina display is stunning, crisp, vibrant, and bright with excellent colour accuracy, making it great for work, streaming, or editing. It lacks ProMotion (120Hz refresh rate) and mini-LED technology compared to the MacBook Pro’s display, so it doesn’t get as bright or offer the same deep blacks and contrast. However, for most users, the Air’s display is impressive.The sound quality is fantastic, with clear, rich audio that fills the room. Despite its size, it’s incredibly light and portable. This MacBook Air is a great choice for most users, unless you crave the Pro’s 16” screen with its superior brightness, contrast, and smoother refresh rate. Highly recommend!\n  \nRead more",

It also has a pretty healthy amount of ports considering its size. I don't travel for work, but if I did, this charging station would also be perfect for travel since it is so compact. The only thing to consider is that power brick as well, which is more or less the same size as the docking station.I haven't had any connectivity or power issues, seems like a very reliable unit. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who just needs a basic laptop docking station.\n  \nRead more",

The correct cable in the pictures appears to have longer connectors with two little holes at the base on each side.For testing, I borrowed the correct cable from a ThinkPad Universal USB-C Dock (40AY) at my office - when using the correct cable, this dock works perfectly, video outputs and all.

I use them with many different brands of computers from Lenovo, Dell, etc. and they've been reliable with everything. They're expensive, but you get what you pay for and this is my go-to dock for Windows machines.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I have become spoiled using 2 external monitors with another laptop I used for several years.  Current laptops' commuting abilities make them usable for me for all my needs whether in the office, traveling, or in class.  However, the small single laptop screen is not as easy to view with my eyes as it was 10 years ago.  I bought a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon, Gen 7 based on previous good performance of an earlier Thinkpad.  This docking station works well, but like most new laptops it connects via the super/lightening/all in one USB C connection.  I would prefer the older style connector, but this most be the way PC makers want to go.  The setup was fairly quick and worked almost like plug and play with my two existing monitors.  I had to invest a few minutes to set up the monitor displays as I wanted, but this probably the case with any docking station.  I looked at the cheaper knockoff docking stations, but was not impressed with their reviews.  Some also do not charge the laptop which makes them almost worthless.  This Lenovo branded dock was certainly not cheap and I probably paid a premium for the name.  So far it is working as advertised to charge my laptop and seamlessly switch to the external monitors when I plug it into my laptop.\n  \nRead more",

I was VERY disappointed since i work in digital art. The pen is essential. Now I have to buy a completely separate drawing pad that connects to the laptop that I can use to draw on. Sorely disappointed.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Received the laptop and set it up. A couple of issues.1. The keyboard is not backlit. I figured it would be standard at this price point, but my fault for assuming. I looked at purchasing a backlit keyboard and replacing it. Even though I used to repair laptops in my IT job (retired now), the steps required to replace this one it way too much. Everything comes out to replace it.If you require a backlit keyboard, there is an 12th Gen i5 version (G3), that has it and is very close to this price point. Let my failure push you to do the research.2. Now the stupidity... There is a power port and a USB-C port, which can also provide power. The power port is dedicated to a barrel type power supply and can be used for nothing else. Did they provide a barrel type supply for this machine? No! They provided a USB-C power supply which makes that port unusable when charging.HP is notorious for stupidity with their laptops (yes, I used to repair HP business laptops). They also sent USB-C power supplies with only one port and a dedicated \"barrel type\" port. I don't know if the USB-C supplies are cheaper, but the stupidity to limit the port usage is ridiculous. I thought Lenovo was better than HP, but they proved me wrong.The laptop itself is good. I like the textured case as fingerprints will not be an issue with this design. The laptop it replaced was about about 9 years old and needed to go to recycle. This one is plenty fast and the screen looks very good. The Ryzen 5, NVMe storage and Wi-Fi 6 allows this machine to be almost instantaneous when opening apps and browsers. I can live with the non-backlit keyboard and a barrel type supply is about $20. It is already in my cartI let my old failing laptop push me into a premature purchase. Do the research before buying.Additional note:  I saw another review stating that this is not a gaming laptop. That is accurate. It states that it has a Radeon chipset for video, but it is not discrete (not a standalone processor with a high enough core count and dedicated memory to run the majority of games). If you are thinking about using this for gaming,. keep shopping. Only a laptop with discrete graphics (Nvidia 1600, 20, 30 and 40 GeForce series) will be able to run most games. I haven't seen many laptops with discrete AMD Radeon graphic options. This laptop won't do it. I have a different machine for gaming.\n  \nRead more",

I sent it in to Lenovo who told me there was water damage (what? It was nowhere near water, but ok...) and it costed over $400 to fix. I thought they were the ones with the year long accidental protection warranty which was the whole reason I bought this particular laptop. It offered a one year accident protection warranty. Once Lenovo told me the damage was not covered by them and that it was the seller who was responsible for that guarantee, I messaged the seller. Repeatedly. I got nothing. Not even a reply. So, while the laptop is acceptable, you shouldn't buy it from this seller. They don't honor they're warranty or even contact you back. So now I'm out $700 for a laptop I desperately need, no way to replace it, and no money to fix it. I'll be watching out for products from this seller to avoid from now on!\n  \nRead more",

The revised 120mm glass touchpad is larger than the last one (110mm) and still includes the familiar ThinkPad buttons at the top. Other changes include a slightly smaller form factor, thinner bezels providing a 5% higher screen-to-body ratio and it’s even lighter, just 2.41 pounds without the charger!",

I could occasionally get 2 external 4k displays working at 30 Hz, but I couldn't reliably reenact the magical incantations necessary for this.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I bought my first Lenovo ThinkPad Universal Docking Station in November 2023, when I bought a new Lenovo Laptop. I registered my ThinkPad with Lenovo and it had a 3 year warranty on it. They thought is was odd because it was set up for Australia they told me by the serial number. I was told to just update the firmware & drivers and it should work fine. Lenovo didn't know much about it, but updated drivers and firmware and told me I had to deal with ThinkPad if I was having issues with it. When I contacted ThinkPad they refused to help me and told me Lenovo had to help me. Went round and round for 6 months. I wasn't certain it was the docking station and not the laptop, but eventually got there. I remembered a week or two ago, when it wasn't working right (The ports on the docking station worked intermittently, and it was getting worse and worse.) that I had an Asurion Policy on it. Asurion took great care of me and had me mail it to the manufacturer. They kept it for over a week and the end of the 2nd week Asurion sent me an email saying they couldn't fix it and sent me my money back. So, I bought another one from the same seller and this one when I registered it said it was for Germany. It was starting to goof up on the same way and I returned it. I bought a used on ebay that is registered for use in the US and still has some warranty left on it. A lot of good that will do with ThinkPad refusing service, but at least I know it is for U.S. use. If you get one for the US it is an great little docking station, but my older HP docking station did better than two made for other countries.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Recently want to upgrade my Lenovo Thinkpad TB3 dock to this new version, but I found even it fully support Lenovo's own legion laptop with HDMI 2.1 over 4k@120hz. I checked the display info, it shows the card is wired through 'display port' internally. confirmed in game, it's just 4k@120hz, no G-sync, I think it's a limitation on LG CX, it's a special protocol used by LG and nvidia to arrange G-sync compatible.It couldn't output any HDMI signal from my Intel 2019 MacBook Pro 16. I had to use a downstream TB4 port on this dock then connect another USB-C to HDMI 2.0 cable and output to my tv, of course it's limited to 4k 60hzHowever, it does support my Intel 2020 MacBook Pro 13 and 2021 MacBook Pro 16 which is very strange. Of course, all of them are HDMI 2.0 due to limitation of MacOSAnd it does USB PD charge with 92w to MacBook Pro but it can't deliver any power to its own Lenovo Legion 7i, even though Legion can support 100w PD charging from TB4 port.Now I'm very confused by this dock. btw, firmware updated to newest 1.07 on lenovo website.Update on 6/5/2023:After a firmware update  a while ago, it finally support M1 MacBook output 4k@60hz directly from HDMI port, but too bad due to Mac limitation, it's only HDMI 2.0 signal so no 4k@120hz.But I do \"solve\" this problem by recent hack from community using a special adapter to convert TB/DP alt signal to HDMI 2.1, I won't go into details, just search Thunderbolt -> HDMI 2.1 solution for M1/2 Mac for solution\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I normally don't write reviews, however I had to do quite a bit of research before I landed on this one. Disclaimer towards all my views here, I bought this \"Very Good\" condition used on Amazon for around 140$ shipped. My attitude and rating reflect that price point.I am able to connect this to my Macbook, it charges my laptop and I am able to get two DISTINCT external screens. It took some fiddling to do this. I have two external monitors I use, a Samsung Neo G8 32inch 4k 240HZ and LG 27inch 4k 144Hz.My initial setup was to use this dock to power my mac and run the Neo G8 through the display port with a seperate thunderbolt input for the LG direct into the laptop via DP to TB cable. I was not able to get the Neo G8 to start up with either DP port on the dock. Neither the standalone nor the one that shares its chipset with the HDMI. I tried installing the DisplayLink drivers but it didn't recognize my monitors. I realized it may be my settings and permissions, but I'd have to weaken security too much through the kernel to do this just for DisplayLink. However, I found that the port was able to support DP to my LG monitor. So using DP to the LG, and then connecting my second monitor to the TB4 port on the dock via a DP to TB cable, I was able to get two distinct screens out of this. So before you go thinking that it doesn't work from one of the DP ports, check against another monitor. And use the DP port that's standalone (not stacked with HDMI) for testing, that one runs on a better chipset. Note that I believe that if you want to drive two screens on this, one of them must use the TB4 port. The others will all mirror each other if you're using a Mac.The Macbook works with this, but it doesn't play well. For my needs it's sufficient after passing the setup headache. Things I still have to watch it for. I use my dock with my laptop in clamshell mode, laptop lid closed. Sometimes it wont wake from sleep using my keyboard, meaning I have to open the laptop, login. Sometimes an additional step of replugging the port in is needed. The audio jack in the front works from single port mic and audio. It's well powered but dont plug your headphones in and out all the time when it's docked. The system has to re-register that there is an audio device present and sometimes it takes a bit.That all being said, I believe this is one of the better TB4 ports that you can make work with the Mac M1. If I had to spend 300$ on a dock, I'd probably go with Caldigit, more straight forward especially with everything having a thunderbolt converter cable these days. But for that price I could buy two of these at today's price.Best of luck.\n  \nRead more",

The dock box is basically the same so I thought I would add to the review.  The dock is okay, but it is far less obtrusive than my the dock station for my old Dell Precision 6800.  The old dell dock was very neat and resulted in far fewer cords dangling on my desk.  That said, I do not see how they could do much better given the frame size of the X1 carbon.

For those needs this tablet more than delivers. It is not by any means a powerhouse, and I'd not recommend it if you want to play games or even open a bunch on chrome tabs, but it opens the apps I need it to open adequately fast, and the speakers, albeit a bit flat, are plenty lound. I had tried to use a Fire tablet for the same purpose and sent it back immediately,- it was laggy, slow, speakers were bad and I couldn't install Brave browser on it. All in all - if you are buying this tablet for light use cases - it works great. \n  \nRead more",

It shipped with its own carry case, saving us the cost and bother of ordering a separate case. My tablet is also on the older side, so I'm a bit envious now.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "So Hubby has needed a laptop for a good minute. We usually buy his refurbished bc he doesn't use a computer as much as I do. A #TB hard drive and top-shelf or even mid-level graphics card would be wasted on him, but he does need a laptop to access work files from home and general computer tomfoolery.So his last system was a refurb/open box Lenovo Ideapad, 4g RAM, and 1T hard drive. We got it from BestBuy Outlet a few years ago. It was so nice I told my sister about it and she got the same one.Fast forward to last December and the age was showing. I think the manufacture date is 2019, and it's showing the age. I was using it for work (WFH) bc he didn't need it. But then he DID need it so I had to go to a backup until he got me a desktop (see review).The BB Lenovo was slow, so very slow it was like Chinese water torture. Booting it up took time, yeah, 2-5 minutes depending on its mood. I'm not talking from shutdown. I mean from sleep/hibernation to lock screen to desktop. Painfully slow, so we needed to upgrade him.  We couldn't shell out a lot of money for it, though, so I went shopping.This system has good storage for him. He doesn't take enough pix or do enough browsing to need more than 512G so the extra 128G is just gravy. The 12G RAM is a major step up and he's no longer grumbling about how slow his computer is.Yay.I'm a little jelly. This thing is sleek. At this price, we could afford to grab another.  I just got a gamer desktop, though (see review!) so it's not practical.Pros: See abovePlus: That card slot is a good thing since it doesn't have a CD/DVD tray at all (see pic).The camera cover/lock is NICE (see pic). I always tape a little paper over webcams but there's no need with this.One of the USB ports is a USB-C (see pic), which is nice since things seem to be moving that way.I thought I was settling for the 15.6\" screen but it's not as small as I thought it would be. My desktop system monitors are 22 and 24 inches respectively and my last laptop was 17\", so 15\" feels small to me until I actually see it.As stated: Hubby doesn't care. This laptop is the same size as his old one and even the same manufacturer, so yeah. He's good.Cons:No disc tray. Anything he needs to physically add has to be on an SD card, thumb drive, or downloaded. Please note: Hubby doesn't care.For my geeky/gamer heart, it's not nearly enough HD space, but for Hubby it's perfect.The preinstalled bloatware insists on being used even when you uninstall it, but isn't it always?Minimal ports. I need way more USB ports and no ethernet is a deal breaker for me.Caveat: This laptop isn't for me, since I have a gaming/work desktop system. Hubby doesn't care about this at all, so it's just a \"that would be nice\" thing.Anyway,  I like this machine a lot. It's light and clean and a fantastic value for the price. I think it will serve Hubby well.9/10 would recommend.\n  \nRead more",

It could be used to keep up with email and social networks and watch a few video streams while in hotels. The memory and drive space looked good, as did battery life and weight.But boy! Was I ever wrong!This has to be the absolutely, most abysmally SLOW machine I have ever used - - and I have been computing since 1978! The 1.1GHz Celeron processor is totally inadequate to support Windows 11 or any modern website or application. It stays pegged at 100% usage from the moment you boot the machine. Speaking of booting, can you believe this machine is still loading apps and functions after TEN MINUTES from a fresh start? Not just from a new OS update, but EVERY time you do a restart.Trying to use the browser is an exercise in frustration. For example, bringing up more than one window to compare products on a store website results in locking up the browser to the point it can't even show the browser's menu or other toolbars on the 3rd page and beyond, let alone displaying the actual page contents. And forget trying to watch a \"YouTube Short\". You can hear the audio (sometimes), but the video stays frozen on the first image until the short has completed. Even on the repetition, the image and audio spits and stutters like an old slide show instead of showing a steady video stream.Give up any hope of playing any interactive game on this dog. You can actually count the seconds between a key stroke or mouse click and the game's acceptance of the input.In fact, this laptop is SO SLOW, that I can routinely type ahead of the display when doing things like submitting this review, chatting on Discord, or creating a Word document. I haven't been able to do that since I worked on old green-screen Hazeltine monitors 40+ years ago!Bottom line: This machine is inadequate for even simple tasks like keeping up with your email or sending chat texts through social apps like X, Discord, etc.I would be rid of it in a second if circumstances hadn't prevented me from returning it prior to the 30-day window expiring!Save your money and look elsewhere for a machine that performs better than an antique 386!\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "This is a very nice entry level 1080p high refresh rate ips gaming monitor at its current price point I would definitely recommend it.When I first got it and powered it on I was not very impressed as the default settings make the colors look very washed out and appear less vibrant then my benq tn panel monitor, but after playing around with the settings I got the colors on par maybe a tiny bit better then my benq. Ips is supposed to have better colors then tn panels, but I don't notice a huge difference between the two, but would say this monitor looks slightly better.Turning on srgb or hdr wrecks the colors and makes them very muddy or faded looking. This monitor does support hdr, but it is not an actual hdr monitor so imo using the hdr setting is pointless because it makes the monitors colors look horrible. Srgb is probably more color accurate, but again makes the colors appear slightly washed out and faded. So when you get it just spend some time adjusting the monitor settings and you can get it looking very nice just avoid the srgb and the hdr settings imo.This monitor has very little or no physical bezel which looks great, but it has what I would refer to as a digital bezel. I don't understand the point of removing the physical bezel if your just going to replace it with a virtual/digital bezel on the actual screen. That said it does look a lot nicer then the big thick plastic bezel on my benq as shown in the photos.The monitors menus to adjust the settings is laid out nice and pretty easy to navigate or adjust the settings quickly and easily. Monitor runs no problem at up to180hz, 1ms or less response rate, has amd freesync, over drive, MPRT, The dark boost setting is nice and works as expected making the blacks appear nice and dark. This monitor definitely has darker nicer looking blacks then my benq tn panel does.The stand while it is pretty wide I really like it. It may be wider then some monitor stand, but it does not protrude forward and stick out as much as a lot of other monitor stand. Its very stable and I have no concerns with it being unstable at any angle or adjustment. As for the adjust ability of the monitor and stand its really good and is more adjustable then my benq.Over all its a very nice monitor especially for the price and I would definitely recommend it as long as you don't require HDR. If it was between this Lenovo legion r24e vs my 1080p 144hz benq zowie I would recommend this Lenovo over the benq.\n  \nRead more",

The statement-making triangular base is very large -- it measures 18.75 inches wide x 10 inches deep. That takes up quite a bit of real estate if you're a professional with other stuff on your desk. The backlit, edge-to-edge screen on three sides is nice. The exterior dimensions of the monitor are 21.25 inches wide x 12.75 inches tall. It's cool that the screen pivot and rotates. It also lifts and lowers, which was confusing to me pre-install because there aren't any fixed stops for height on the stem, but the screen's weight keeps it at the chosen height when assembled. Installation/assembly was easy and the monitor is plug and play.\n  \nRead more",
