The display is not very clear or bright and when pix are displayed they are not the quality that you see on a phone. Understand why you are buying it beforehand. In my case, this computer was very cheap ($400) and I wanted it for reading the paper in the morning and emails. So it’s fine for that. Don’t get it as your primary computer.I’m satisfied with the purchase but could easily see it not meeting your needs.

I know the font could be enlarged after setup. The computer did not have a touch screen which I use on my current computer because my hand is too shaky to use the touchpad. To set it up, I had to use the touchpad and read the small text.  I am 80 years old, had to use a magnifying glass to even see the curser so after spending about 2 hours trying to get it set up, I decided it was not the machine for me.  I contacted Amazon and got return instructions, stating my reasons for not keeping it. I reset the machine and packaged it up and returned through UPS Store.It probably would be good for someone who is younger and more computer literate.  It did have school mode and game mode shown as user selections.  Nice looking machine, way lighter than my current one which I need to replace to use Windows 11.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I tested the original Windows system before I removed it without issues and the laptop  was quick to start up and under normal operation it functioned fine. It did appear to be an upgraded Windows 7 computer in the BIOS. Windows was only removed as this was purchased for work where I do \"geek\" computer things that Linux is easier to use.If you are looking for a solid laptop to use for Linux this machine is a solid choice. You will need to go into Windows and change a few settings to do the conversion to whatever Linux Distribution you decide to go with.Pro: It's a very sleek, slim, and fast computer for the price point. It has a ethernet connection point unlike most laptops anymore.Con: I am not a fan of the powercharger that was included and have it currently running off a docking station.Overall I will probably grab another one of these laptops for personal usage.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I have been in technology for almost 50 years. in my lifetime I have used just about everything that computes, calls, calculates, shows time, and locates. I have used it, sold it, broke it, and repaired it, from mainframe computers to watches.I needed a new laptop, my old one was 10 years old but still able to run Windows 11. It's tiny and kind of slow, so I searched Amazon exhaustively for a new one and came across this, the 40GB RAM Ryzen 7 Lenovo.I've always been an HP fan but have used Lenovos before, they are always well built and last a long time. This one is probably the best I have seen. I'm not a PC gamer, so I don't need intense graphical speed, but I think the Radeon GPU can handle anything I need to throw at it, and the OS loads in less than 10 seconds. It's light, has a 1TB SSD which is enough room for me, and did I say fast? The RAM can load the whole OS.The keyboard is excellent, I don't need a backlit one, it has every key imaginable, even a side numeric keypad.It's light, VERY light weight, and the perfect form factor for me at 14\". Best design ever.If you don't need a powerhouse for gaming, want to browse the Internet , do your taxes, watch videos, and maybe create a video once in a while, this laptop can do it all. People complain about the viewing angle and video, but I downloaded the latest drivers from AMD and I don't see a problem. It was shipped quickly even to my remote rural community, great seller. Two days.\n  \nRead more",

The screen is a touch screen BUT only if you use your finger or blunted capacitive stylus. Anything with pressure sensitivity or active stylus will not work.I have several from past laptops an none will work. I did some digging and found that pens are not supported by this product. I was VERY disappointed since i work in digital art. The pen is essential. Now I have to buy a completely separate drawing pad that connects to the laptop that I can use to draw on. Sorely disappointed.\n  \nRead more",

Very fast2. The memory upgrade to 24GB pretty much turns this into a mini server. It's a massive upgrade3. 1-TB Storage to complement all of these prior points is icing on the cake. It is very responsive.4. The build quality is excellent as expected from Lenovo.5. light and easy to carry around. very efficient.Cons1. The screen may be my biggest gripe as I always used 15\" Laptops before but it's workable.2. The battery life could also be improved. lasts about 2.5hrs with heavy use before a charge3. I note on MS Teams calls there are drops in the connection at times. Did call on my tablet at the same time so I confirmed it's not my internet connection. I'm hoping a network driver update would resolve that. Seems a minor quirk.Got the 2-year protection plan just for peace of mind. Small price to pay in case anything occurs.Overall - love this laptop. I purchased it for the start of my small business and leisure and it does everything well.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Since I have been quite of bit of hands-on data as well as report production and design work for the last few months, I recently tried several options for a portable monitor to use with my 14 Inch MacBook Pro. My requirements when I started were: light weight, single USB C/Thunderbolt (eg no separate power needed), and for it to be approximately the same size as the MacBook at least height-wise.With my first purchase (and return) I quickly found out that despite the many options all touting the same specs, I had to add a few requirements. Shape (needed it to be 14 wide), built-in ability to stand on its own vs a floppy cover solution, and most importantly, reasonably accurate color.  Also, pass-through power is a very nice-to-have so that there's only one USB C Thunderbolt cable connected to the Mac and power can connect to the monitor and pass back through to the Mac through the one Thunderbolt cable.This monitor met all the requirements above. The color is -very- accurate. A side-by-side comparison to the other portables was instantly clear. No need to run through lots of tests (although I did try extensively to adjust them. The ThinkVision worked perfectly out of the box.Another really nice feature is the way they implemented the \"kickstand\".  It's not really a kickstand but more of a fold-out base. The connections are built in to that which offset them from the edge of the screen unlike all the others, which means you can stand it up right against the Mac even with cables plugged into both sides.I -thought- I was going to have to trade off weight when comparing choices, but I am certain this is the same and possibly lighter than the Arzopa, my second choice.  I don't have a precise scale to verify this.  However I did a blind \"place one in my hand\" test and picked the lighter as the ThinkVision. If I can get my hands on a scale while I still have these I will update. Be aware that the specs claim the others are all lighter than the ThinkVision, which again I doubt.  In any case, it is negligible either way.Lastly, as a nice feature, it comes with a felt sleeve.  This is perfect for my bike bag and backpack to protect against scratches or worse.The one trade-off that is real is the price. This is approximately 90ish dollars more than several other appealing-looking options currently.  Make no mistake, this monitor is worth that and more if you are planning to use it often at all. Personally I will always pay for true quality if a piece of equipment is clearly better than the rest. If you are a Mac user you probably feel the same. This monitor is a worthy companion for a road warrior, anyone who moves their work spot often, or just wants to keep their work space flexible.\n  \nRead more",

I love the fold out stand on the back. I have purchased 2 other laptop monitors for my staff and they use magnetically attached covers which have proved to be a real pain. This set up is much better for me.The resolution is colors are great. I can match the color of my MacBook for consistency across both monitors. I do graphic design and it works well for that. I can work anywhere on the road simply by pulling the computer and monitor out of the backpack and I am at work.It's rugged and I highly recommend it.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "I bought both a Lenovo M14 and M14t (with touch).The M14 is a great portable monitor. I have several generic portable monitors for various uses but found the folding cover/stand most of them have to be hard to use. They’d often fall over.The stand on the M14 is great. It allows for tilt and limited height adjustment to match your laptop display. The monitor is pretty light, so I do wonder if wind will be an issue trying to use this outdoors.Image quality seems to match my HD IPS Thinkpad displays.This monitor only connects via DisplayPort over USB-C.  Make sure your laptop supports this - not all USB-C ports do.  Also, you can pass power through the monitor, especially useful if all your USB-C ports are in use. It does reduce the power sent to the laptop. My Lenovo 65w USB-C charger shows as a 45w adaptor when connected through one of these monitors. Using a Dell 90w USB-C charger increases the power to 60 watts to the laptop.The monitor supports VESA mounting via screw holes on the bottom of the stand. Clips are included to lock the stand in place when mounted.The case is the only let down. It is a soft felt sleeve, which is nice enough, but doesn’t seem to offer any impact protection to the front of the screen. I bought a rigid laptop bag designed for a 16” MacBook Pro and it comfortably holds both displays in their sleeves and I’m much more comfortable transporting the displays.\n  \nRead more",

Somehow after working virtually, being \"stuck\" with only the laptop screen on trips has been a bit of a headache and does not seem to work anymore - one still has to manage multiple documents while writing or editing plus handle meetings on Zoom or Teams. This screen has come with me to Africa and so far is holding up well. It is light and thin, resting between my two laptops in my shoulder bag. The felt carrying sleeve is nice, shielding it from dings / scratches as it goes into the trays for x-ray checks at all the various airports. It connects easily with the USB-C (my laptop has the latest USB-C but not a Thunderbolt cxn) and works as any other second screen to clone or extend my desktop. As many reviews have noted, it is a bright, colorful screen. It works quite well with my Dell Latitude 7490. My giraffe-in-Masai-Mara background is just as bright on the M14 as on the Dell, and with colors matching between the screens. The frame puts the screen even at the same height as my laptop. The stand holds the screen firmly in position but adjusts as needed.All in all, this is a screen that I would recommend.\n  \nRead more",

Like most IPS panels, the contrast ratio is just okay. Viewing angles are good. Brightness is acceptable, but glare can be an issue in some conditions, e.g. a window behind you during daylight.My 2021 Macbook Pro defaulted to driving this monitor at 960x540, but the image is perfectly sharp when \"scaled\" to its true native resolution of 1920x1080 -- though, with the Mac, that means UI text is quite small.  However, if you're more than about 50cm away from the screen, the lower resolution may be preferable.I would prefer a somewhat higher pixel density, but at 14\" the FHD resolution is an acceptable 157 PPI -- about 70% of what would be considered \"HiDPI\".I would also prefer a 16:10 aspect ratio over 16:9. I think 16:9 is an odd choice here, since this monitor is clearly intended for productivity rather than media consumption -- and most of Lenovo's own productivity-oriented ThinkPad laptops use 16:10 as well.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "Overall this is a decent, value oriented basic laptop. It will perform most of the stuff a student needs with a very simple version of MS Office. But at this price, please realize that it isn't built for games. (That may be a good thing if you want your kid to get their assignments finished on time ;0) To save some ca$h, I bought the \"Used - Like New\" version. The laptop I received probably had an older “generic image” of software reloaded for resale. As such, it required a couple years’ worth of Windows 11 updates, which can be frustrating. After a few failed attempts including one infamous Microsoft BSOD, I finally got the thing running reliably stable. But that took quite some time researching and downloading additional \"update repair\" software readily available at Microsoft’s websites after following advice from user forums. In my experience this is not unusual with MS. Their products have to work on many different brands of machines, which is not an easy thing to achieve. If you want a sturdy metal frame “good to go right out of the box” machine, buy a refurbed, slightly older Apple laptop for a little bit more. I’ve had several of those too. Apple has tight controls on both their hardware and software products. They work well and last a long time… As they say, “You pay for what you get!”\n  \nRead more",

Yeah the old adage \"you get what you pay for\" applies here. Massively.It is SO slow. May as well have 1g of ram. No setting optimization fixes this. NOTHING works properly. Everything is so buggy and crashes often. I bought this to run quickbooks for a business and my 85 year old book keeper was making fun of me for how slow it was and how I shouldn't have cheaped out and bought this POS.Yeah imagine an 80+ yr old man complaining about how slow a \"new\" computer is. It's that bad and worse.The screen is literally the worst screen I've ever seen in real life. Laptops 10+ years older have a screen that blows this away. It actually hurts my eyes after about 30 minutes and that's never happened to me before. It is so hard to look at.The whole thing is SUPER cheap. The keyboard layout is stupid and if you're used to a normal keyboard get ready to hit the wrong keys constantly.There is no redeeming quality to this laptop. It's absolutely garbage DO NOT BUY. It's probably not even worth the aggravation trying to get everything off of it and return, so the best I can hope for is some good karma put out in the universe saving some other poor souls the misfortune of buying this POS.Do not buy. You're welcome.\n  \nRead more",

When it arrived I tried to turn on the backlight but nothing worked yet I still believed what the review had said. So I tried for HOURS to get it to work. Impossible, of course. In the process I also discovered that the computer was extremely slow and updating it bogged down, took hours and then didn't fully update. I searched for info on how to turn on the backlight back when I still believed there was one and ended up on a site that locked my computer and insisted I not try to turn it off because that could result in identity theft and they gave a phone number to call. Oh sure. I'd never call. It was all a scam and I don't know why my Malwarebytes didn't block that site. Anyway, that did it. I packaged it up and sent it back to Amazon despite my personal info on the computer that I couldn't remove because of the scam site locking the computer. Horrible experience. Went to a local store, bought another model Dell, one with a backlight,, and it's working great. I hope Amazon refunds me for the one that became a brick.\n  \nRead more",

I was hesitant about non-intel but this Ryzen 7 is. as they say in commercials, \"blazing fast\", - the unit is upgraded by GreatPriceTech to have the RAM I wanted and they added a USB hub so that the laptop only having two built in USB ports is not an issue. Shipping was prompt, unit arrived in excellent condition. Warranty is directly with the dealer and not Lenovo but so far no issues so hopefully don't have to test that although my experience with factory warranty help is that hopefully it can't be worse.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "So Hubby has needed a laptop for a good minute. We usually buy his refurbished bc he doesn't use a computer as much as I do. A #TB hard drive and top-shelf or even mid-level graphics card would be wasted on him, but he does need a laptop to access work files from home and general computer tomfoolery.So his last system was a refurb/open box Lenovo Ideapad, 4g RAM, and 1T hard drive. We got it from BestBuy Outlet a few years ago. It was so nice I told my sister about it and she got the same one.Fast forward to last December and the age was showing. I think the manufacture date is 2019, and it's showing the age. I was using it for work (WFH) bc he didn't need it. But then he DID need it so I had to go to a backup until he got me a desktop (see review).The BB Lenovo was slow, so very slow it was like Chinese water torture. Booting it up took time, yeah, 2-5 minutes depending on its mood. I'm not talking from shutdown. I mean from sleep/hibernation to lock screen to desktop. Painfully slow, so we needed to upgrade him.  We couldn't shell out a lot of money for it, though, so I went shopping.This system has good storage for him. He doesn't take enough pix or do enough browsing to need more than 512G so the extra 128G is just gravy. The 12G RAM is a major step up and he's no longer grumbling about how slow his computer is.Yay.I'm a little jelly. This thing is sleek. At this price, we could afford to grab another.  I just got a gamer desktop, though (see review!) so it's not practical.Pros: See abovePlus: That card slot is a good thing since it doesn't have a CD/DVD tray at all (see pic).The camera cover/lock is NICE (see pic). I always tape a little paper over webcams but there's no need with this.One of the USB ports is a USB-C (see pic), which is nice since things seem to be moving that way.I thought I was settling for the 15.6\" screen but it's not as small as I thought it would be. My desktop system monitors are 22 and 24 inches respectively and my last laptop was 17\", so 15\" feels small to me until I actually see it.As stated: Hubby doesn't care. This laptop is the same size as his old one and even the same manufacturer, so yeah. He's good.Cons:No disc tray. Anything he needs to physically add has to be on an SD card, thumb drive, or downloaded. Please note: Hubby doesn't care.For my geeky/gamer heart, it's not nearly enough HD space, but for Hubby it's perfect.The preinstalled bloatware insists on being used even when you uninstall it, but isn't it always?Minimal ports. I need way more USB ports and no ethernet is a deal breaker for me.Caveat: This laptop isn't for me, since I have a gaming/work desktop system. Hubby doesn't care about this at all, so it's just a \"that would be nice\" thing.Anyway,  I like this machine a lot. It's light and clean and a fantastic value for the price. I think it will serve Hubby well.9/10 would recommend.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "At first glance, this seemed like a decent product for a lightweight machine to take on trips. It could be used to keep up with email and social networks and watch a few video streams while in hotels. The memory and drive space looked good, as did battery life and weight.But boy! Was I ever wrong!This has to be the absolutely, most abysmally SLOW machine I have ever used - - and I have been computing since 1978! The 1.1GHz Celeron processor is totally inadequate to support Windows 11 or any modern website or application. It stays pegged at 100% usage from the moment you boot the machine. Speaking of booting, can you believe this machine is still loading apps and functions after TEN MINUTES from a fresh start? Not just from a new OS update, but EVERY time you do a restart.Trying to use the browser is an exercise in frustration. For example, bringing up more than one window to compare products on a store website results in locking up the browser to the point it can't even show the browser's menu or other toolbars on the 3rd page and beyond, let alone displaying the actual page contents. And forget trying to watch a \"YouTube Short\". You can hear the audio (sometimes), but the video stays frozen on the first image until the short has completed. Even on the repetition, the image and audio spits and stutters like an old slide show instead of showing a steady video stream.Give up any hope of playing any interactive game on this dog. You can actually count the seconds between a key stroke or mouse click and the game's acceptance of the input.In fact, this laptop is SO SLOW, that I can routinely type ahead of the display when doing things like submitting this review, chatting on Discord, or creating a Word document. I haven't been able to do that since I worked on old green-screen Hazeltine monitors 40+ years ago!Bottom line: This machine is inadequate for even simple tasks like keeping up with your email or sending chat texts through social apps like X, Discord, etc.I would be rid of it in a second if circumstances hadn't prevented me from returning it prior to the 30-day window expiring!Save your money and look elsewhere for a machine that performs better than an antique 386!\n  \nRead more",

                "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Powerful console. Windows 11 is totally fine.",
                "review": "I bought the Legion Go used, listed as in “very good” condition, and to my relief, it really was—basically like new. However, one major issue made my first few hours with the device basically a nightmare. It came with Windows 11 Pro installed, but the device is licensed only for Windows 11 Home. Since I didn’t own a Pro license, I had to wipe the system and do a full reinstall of Windows 11 Home via USB. (Be very careful with which partitions you delete.) If you’re buying used, be ready with a USB drive, a copy of Windows 11 Home (available free from Microsoft), and ideally a plug-in keyboard. If you’re buying new, this won’t be a problem. (If you accidentally delete another partition for other drivers, reinstalling Windows may not install them, but you can install them with the USB you have. Someone I know did that...)As for the console itself—overall, I like it. It’s powerful and the screen looks fantastic. The buttons are mostly fine, though the joysticks don’t feel as firm as PS5 or Xbox sticks, which I consider to be excellent. That said, I usually play FPS games with mouse and keyboard, so take that with a grain of salt. The Go’s software lets you tweak joystick dead zones, which really can help make the joysticks feel less bad in FPS games. Windows vs Steam vs Bazzite? This is a PC with joysticks—Windows runs normally, and the Steam app (*not* the OS) works as expected. I appreciate being able to play anti-cheat games like Destiny 2, so Windows 11 is actually a plus. This is a Windows PC. If you hook a mouse and keyboard to it, you have a Windows PC with detachable joysticks (the built in stand is a plus). The Legion software seems a bit inconsistent, but it hasn’t caused problems. I don't really interact with it. The dedicated performance tuning app (tied to a separate physical button) is genuinely useful. Battery life depends on what you’re playing. I get about 50 minutes unplugged while pushing it hard (Path of Exile 2 on aggressive settings), but indie titles on power-saver do better. That said, battery life isn’t great—expect to be near an outlet for heavier games. (I mainly use it for heavier games.) Overall, I like the Legion Go. I'm not a heavy portable gamer, but I appreciate the added convenience and continuity of gaming that it provides. It's a chunky device but it feels well made. I like that I can plug a mouse and keyboard in and play FPS games, or use it as a portable game console with the attached controllers.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "This thing is incredible. I wasn't sure whether I should get the steamdeck, ROG Ally, or Legion Go. I am so glad I got this. I love how versatile this thing is. Works great for modern games as works amazingly as an emulator.This can be used a handheld console, or you can detach the controllers and have a more home console feel. With the controllers detached, it also works incredibly well as a tablet for getting work done or watching movies/shows. This may also be better for bring to certain workplaces over a steamdeck or ROG Ally because of the detachable controllers. You can bring it to work without bring any attention to yourself because it can look like a normal tablet instead of a giant game boy with the controllers attached.The screen was the biggest factor in me buying this though, and it does not disappoint. That giant screen makes it hard to go back to the competition. Not just the size, but the resolution, and color accuracy is just beautiful. You may not be able to play AAA modern titles on High settings with the max 1600p resolution, but you can scale it down to meet your needs and it still looks incredible. For me the resolution is not overkill, because I can still take advantage of the max resolution when emulating classic games, and movies and shows look incredible with the 1600 resolution on this device.The kickstand is AMAZING. It may seem trivial, and it did to me at first, I had no idea how useful this kickstand was going to be and to have it be built into the device without needing any kind of case or accessory is so convenient.I've had this device for about a month, and I guess they must have updated and patched the Legion Space software quite a bit since it's released because I haven't had any issues with it. I love that this runs on windows and has all the potential that comes with it, but I can also use things like Legion Space and Steam Big Picture to have a simplified console UI if I want as well. With a couple accessories like a keyboard and a USB hub, this Legion Go has essentially replaced my xbox, my laptop, my gaming pc, and all my handhelds. I can do everything I need on this one device. By far my favorite purchase this year so far, could not recommend it enough.\n  \nRead more",

I enjoy having more power to run more intensive games and the much larger compatibility of games and the flexibility of windows to do more productivity tasks as well.

I looked at purchasing a backlit keyboard and replacing it. Even though I used to repair laptops in my IT job (retired now), the steps required to replace this one it way too much. Everything comes out to replace it.If you require a backlit keyboard, there is an 12th Gen i5 version (G3), that has it and is very close to this price point. Let my failure push you to do the research.2. Now the stupidity... There is a power port and a USB-C port, which can also provide power. The power port is dedicated to a barrel type power supply and can be used for nothing else. Did they provide a barrel type supply for this machine? No! They provided a USB-C power supply which makes that port unusable when charging.HP is notorious for stupidity with their laptops (yes, I used to repair HP business laptops). They also sent USB-C power supplies with only one port and a dedicated \"barrel type\" port. I don't know if the USB-C supplies are cheaper, but the stupidity to limit the port usage is ridiculous. I thought Lenovo was better than HP, but they proved me wrong.The laptop itself is good. I like the textured case as fingerprints will not be an issue with this design. The laptop it replaced was about about 9 years old and needed to go to recycle. This one is plenty fast and the screen looks very good. The Ryzen 5, NVMe storage and Wi-Fi 6 allows this machine to be almost instantaneous when opening apps and browsers. I can live with the non-backlit keyboard and a barrel type supply is about $20. It is already in my cartI let my old failing laptop push me into a premature purchase. Do the research before buying.Additional note:  I saw another review stating that this is not a gaming laptop. That is accurate. It states that it has a Radeon chipset for video, but it is not discrete (not a standalone processor with a high enough core count and dedicated memory to run the majority of games). If you are thinking about using this for gaming,. keep shopping. Only a laptop with discrete graphics (Nvidia 1600, 20, 30 and 40 GeForce series) will be able to run most games. I haven't seen many laptops with discrete AMD Radeon graphic options. This laptop won't do it. I have a different machine for gaming.\n  \nRead more",

I sent it in to Lenovo who told me there was water damage (what? It was nowhere near water, but ok...) and it costed over $400 to fix. I thought they were the ones with the year long accidental protection warranty which was the whole reason I bought this particular laptop. It offered a one year accident protection warranty. Once Lenovo told me the damage was not covered by them and that it was the seller who was responsible for that guarantee, I messaged the seller. Repeatedly. I got nothing. Not even a reply. So, while the laptop is acceptable, you shouldn't buy it from this seller. They don't honor they're warranty or even contact you back. So now I'm out $700 for a laptop I desperately need, no way to replace it, and no money to fix it. I'll be watching out for products from this seller to avoid from now on!\n  \nRead more",

I purchased a Lenovo ThinkCentre mini desktop with an i7 processor and 32GB of RAM that was working perfectly until Lenovo decided to \"update\" the BIOS and bricked it. Originally, Lenovo said they'd repair the PC, which was still under warranty. I sent the PC to their depot, who replaced the mobo, claimed they tested it, and sent it back to me. It still didn't work. Then Lenovo said the processor and memory needed to be replaced. After 2 months of runaround, I found out that Lenovo would only replace the i7 processor with an i5 processor and only provide 8GB of RAM, since that was what came with the base model. So now I have to pay for a processor and memory to get the PC back to its original specifications. You might want to check the Lenovo website for the specs of the base model, because that's all you're going to get back if you have to send to Lenovo for repair.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "This mini PC has everything I needed. Portability, and power. Currently, I am living in California, but before that I was living in China for many years. In the next few months, I’ll be in Vietnam for a while before returning back to China. Carrying an entire rig around with me is a bit unrealistic, and while a laptop is portable, the power I’d need would be ridiculous. They just aren’t good for gaming( dedicated gaming laptops included). The GEEKOM AX8 is different.This thing can easily handle everything I need for work, but where it really shines for me is that it allows me to game. This isn’t going to be the most powerful gaming device of course, but for me it is perfect. I was able to play SW Battlefront 2 all on medium settings at a locked 60fps. That is seriously impressive for an all-in-one device that could literally fit in my jacket pocket. Persona 3 reload, Oblivion Remastered, and a bunch of other RPGs worked incredibly well.You have plenty of usb ports, additional USB-C, internal fan is not loud whatsoever, power consumption is absolutely locked down, and the WiFi connection on this thing beats my 2019 Huawei mate book, easily. I was in dire need of an upgrade and this was it! I’m honestly so happy I got this, my only regret was not waiting another week for another paycheck to get the stronger version.Go into this knowing what you want. This is not going to be a monster rig that will handle every game on ultra settings. But it is a surprisingly powerful device that fits in the palm of your hand, and will meet most of your needs. If you want a little extra GPU, you can get an external one (that’s my plan) to really get this baby going.No more lugging around a stupid laptop that can’t even handle what I want. Wireless mouse and keyboard is all I need. I’ve already taken it to a hotel, connect it to the TV, and was able to bring all my work, and games, with me. Insane work, GEEKOM.You genuinely have earned a loyal customer. It is a fantastic device, I’ve already put so many hours into it, and has been an absolute game changer for me. The world of Mini-PCs truly excites me.\n  \nRead more",

                "review": "This purchase was an easy experience for me. I had been looking to upgrade my desktop computer, but motherboard, CPU, and RAM prices made it difficult to spend the money. I had been reading a lot of reviews of AMD's RYZEN series of processors, and that was what I wanted. I began to look at the mini computers and found one I really liked and ordered it.The PC arrived the very next day and was a little more than 1/2 the price I was expecting to pay for a PC upgrade. That same weekend, I unpackaged it and set it up. The PC case was very sturdy aluminum and had sufficient cooling from what I could see. I got it connected and started it up. I could not believe the size of this thing! It was very compact and looked nice. After I got through setting up Windows 11, it was time to play.I looked at the storage capacity of the computer and liked that it had a fast, late generation SSD of 1TB capacity. Nice! Now to connect to my network. At first, it was WiFi, and that was very fast fast. I ultimately set it up via Ethernet, which was the plan anyway (I'm a home network security nut). I opened one of the games I play called Xonotic. It is a free FPS, but has network connectivity. I joined one of the clans and tore up some enemies! My network speed was fast, and one of the things I have enabled on my \"HUD\" is the frame rate. The Radeon 780X mobile GPU gave me persistently higher frame rates than I was used to with my nVidia GPU. BONUS! Overall, my experience with this Geekom mini PC (AX8 Max) has been great, and I am looking forward to a few years of great productivity and gaming.\n  \nRead more",

I was a little worried I would be compromising as I always have purchased desktops with the intent to upgrade but this little system has everything I need.  Set up was a breeze with Windows 11 Pro.  I have been working on my photo archive and my older system was struggling with handing photos for minor editing where as this mini-beast made photo management and editing super fast and simple. As I always have a couple systems in our home, I am thinking of buy another one of these rather than dealing with an older slower system. I havent really done much gaming but I will try it out once I have more time. I see no issues with memory and I never hear the fan kick on to be honest so the cooling system must be doing its job. Video quality is smooth and crisp hooked up to my 32 in Samsung TV.\n  \nRead more",

Found that It was obviously not a \"new\" computer as promised.  Looked like whoever refurbished it screwed something up because it went straight to a \"Defaultuser0\" account that was disabled.  Asurion person tried to help me do a factory reset but there was no option to do that after hitting the F12 button on startup.  tried several other things but none worked.  She told me the computer would have to be replaced.  She connected me to an Amazon Rep who then told me replacement was not an option - only choice was a refund.  Of course, if I wanted to get the refund then purchase it again I could not get the original deal - the price had gone up another $100.  I sent it back and went to Wal-Mart to buy a computer.  that one works great and is brand new.  By the way - I had opened the Lenovo box on the bottom of the box.  I later looked at the top and noticed that the \"Lenovo\" water marked tape had been cut and the box re-taped with a clear tape but you can see they did not line up the Lenovo tape to cover up the fact they cut that tape.  No apology from Amazon - waste of a lot of time and now still waiting for the refund (Could bee a week or more they said).  Amazon won't refund the Asurion protection - they said I have to try to get that separately from Asurion.\n  \nRead more",
