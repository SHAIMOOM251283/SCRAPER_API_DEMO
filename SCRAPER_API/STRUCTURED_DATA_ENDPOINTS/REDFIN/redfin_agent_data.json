We had been searching for over a year, and when it came on the market, she helped us act fast to see it and get our offer in to the top of the list due to her great organizational skills. Our offer was accepted and she helped us every step of the way during the contract period and she helped answer all of our questions, as we were first time homebuyers. We would definitely work with her again!",

It was about culture, history, geography and art. I’ve always been fascinated by stories about owning and renting homes in the city. My story began with luxury condos overlooking Central Park that inspired me to become an agent building my business to $20 million in sales over 3 years and closing over 50 deals. I pride myself on listening to client needs and known for being accessible to clients is what motivates me to find their dream home. Clients choose to work with me because of my knowledge, the expertise and experience to successfully close the deal. I love that working at Redfin gives me the opportunity to focus on each client and save them money.",

It was about culture, history, geography and art. I’ve always been fascinated by stories about owning and renting homes in the city. My story began with luxury condos overlooking Central Park that inspired me to become an agent building my business to $20 million in sales over 3 years and closing over 50 deals. I pride myself on listening to client needs and known for being accessible to clients is what motivates me to find their dream home. Clients choose to work with me because of my knowledge, the expertise and experience to successfully close the deal. I love that working at Redfin gives me the opportunity to focus on each client and save them money.",

I have many years experience in various business owner and management roles. Specific to real estate, my experience includes commercial real estate sales, and on a personal level, years of buying,  renovating, flipping and selling residential properties. In addition, I owned commercial real estate where I myself was the property manager involving many tenants.\r\nAfter growing up in Queens,  I have lived on Long Island my entire adult life. Not only will I assist you in finding your home, I am well poised to assure that it's the kind of home that fit your needs, in the community that you want, and in your desired timeframe and budget.",

It was about culture, history, geography and art. I’ve always been fascinated by stories about owning and renting homes in the city. My story began with luxury condos overlooking Central Park that inspired me to become an agent building my business to $20 million in sales over 3 years and closing over 50 deals. I pride myself on listening to client needs and known for being accessible to clients is what motivates me to find their dream home. Clients choose to work with me because of my knowledge, the expertise and experience to successfully close the deal. I love that working at Redfin gives me the opportunity to focus on each client and save them money.",

It was about culture, history, geography and art. I’ve always been fascinated by stories about owning and renting homes in the city. My story began with luxury condos overlooking Central Park that inspired me to become an agent building my business to $20 million in sales over 3 years and closing over 50 deals. I pride myself on listening to client needs and known for being accessible to clients is what motivates me to find their dream home. Clients choose to work with me because of my knowledge, the expertise and experience to successfully close the deal. I love that working at Redfin gives me the opportunity to focus on each client and save them money.",

It was about culture, history, geography and art. I’ve always been fascinated by stories about owning and renting homes in the city. My story began with luxury condos overlooking Central Park that inspired me to become an agent building my business to $20 million in sales over 3 years and closing over 50 deals. I pride myself on listening to client needs and known for being accessible to clients is what motivates me to find their dream home. Clients choose to work with me because of my knowledge, the expertise and experience to successfully close the deal. I love that working at Redfin gives me the opportunity to focus on each client and save them money.",

        "about": "My job as lead agent for Redfin came as a natural progression from my Associate Agent position with Redfin where I was in a support role to Agents.  I have many years experience in various business owner and management roles. Specific to real estate, my experience includes commercial real estate sales, and on a personal level, years of buying,  renovating, flipping and selling residential properties. In addition, I owned commercial real estate where I myself was the property manager involving many tenants.\r\nAfter growing up in Queens,  I have lived on Long Island my entire adult life. Not only will I assist you in finding your home, I am well poised to assure that it's the kind of home that fit your needs, in the community that you want, and in your desired timeframe and budget.",

It was about culture, history, geography and art. I’ve always been fascinated by stories about owning and renting homes in the city. My story began with luxury condos overlooking Central Park that inspired me to become an agent building my business to $20 million in sales over 3 years and closing over 50 deals. I pride myself on listening to client needs and known for being accessible to clients is what motivates me to find their dream home. Clients choose to work with me because of my knowledge, the expertise and experience to successfully close the deal. I love that working at Redfin gives me the opportunity to focus on each client and save them money.",

She kept us apprised about available appointments and always let us know as soon as a new house came on the market. She was honest and forthright- no games. After dealing with several other brokers in the queens area and being disappointed, we felt lucky to find devi is absolutely wonderful to work with. It’s like having a friend on the “inside” that is working for you. She really care about hers clients as well as the community and neighborhood she live in. She is like family now. Thank you devi",
