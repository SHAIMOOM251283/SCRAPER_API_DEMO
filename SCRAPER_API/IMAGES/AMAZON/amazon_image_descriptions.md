**Sankey Diagram**
The Sankey Diagram, created using data from the `AMAZON/lenovo_3.json` file, depicts the hierarchical flow of Lenovo products across three levels: **Category**, **Brand**, and **Series**. Each node represents a unique value from these levels, and the links between them illustrate how many products transition from one level to the next. The width of each link is proportional to the number of products, providing a clear visual representation of how products are distributed from broader categories to specific series.

**Word Cloud**
The Word Cloud, created using data from the `AMAZON/lenovo_3.json` file, visually represents the most frequent terms found in the product **feature bullets** and **full descriptions** of Lenovo products. Words that appear more often are shown in larger font, offering a quick overview of key features and common terms associated with the products.

**Bar Chart**
The Bar Chart, created using data from the `AMAZON/lenovo_3.json` file, visualizes the percentage distribution of customer star ratings (1 to 5 stars) for a Lenovo product. Each bar represents the proportion of reviews at a specific rating level, enabling a clear comparison of user satisfaction.

**Dual-Axis Chart**
The Dual-Axis Chart, created using data from the `AMAZON/lenovo_3.json` file, displays both the estimated **number of reviews** and their corresponding **percentage** for each star rating. The left y-axis shows the review count as bars, while the right y-axis shows the percentage as a line plot, providing a detailed view of both the volume and proportion of customer feedback.

**Pie Chart**
The Pie Chart, created using data from the `AMAZON/lenovo_3.json` file, shows the relative proportions of each star rating in a circular format. It highlights how customer reviews are distributed across the five rating levels, giving a quick snapshot of overall product sentiment.
