The Treemap, created using data from the `EBAY/ebay_products.json` file, visualizes the hierarchical distribution of eBay products by **Brand**, **Condition**, and **Color**. Each rectangle represents a category at one of these levels, with larger areas indicating a higher number of products. This layout provides a clear and compact view of how product characteristics are distributed and related across multiple dimensions.

**Sankey Diagram**

Each node represents a unique value from these categories, while the links between nodes show the quantity of products transitioning from one level to the next. The width of each link corresponds to the number of products, providing a clear visualization of how products are distributed across different brands, their conditions, and where they are located.
